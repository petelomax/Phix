<h1>Guide</h1>
<h3><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h3>

  <p>The CD library is a basic graphic library (GL). In a GL paradigm you use <strong>primitives</strong>, which have
  <strong>attributes</strong>, to draw on a <strong>canvas</strong>. All the library functions reflect this paradigm.</p>
  <p>The <strong>canvas</strong> is the basic element. It can have several forms: a paper, a video monitor, a graphic 
  file format, etc. The virtual drawing surface where the canvas exists is represented by a <strong>driver</strong>. 
  Only the driver knows how to draw on its surface. The user does not use the driver directly, but only the canvas.</p>
  <p>To make the library simple we use the concept of an active canvas, over which all the primitives are drawn. This 
  also allows the use of an expansion mechanism using function tables. Unfortunately if a function is called without an 
  active canvas a memory invasion will occur. On the other hand, the mechanism allows the library to be expanded with 
  new drivers without limits.</p>
  <p>The <strong>attributes</strong> are also separated from the primitives. They reside in the canvas in a state 
  mechanism. If you change the attribute's state in the canvas all the primitives drawn after that canvas and that 
  depend on the attribute will be drawn in a different way.</p>
  <p>The set of <strong>primitives</strong> is very small but complete enough to compose a GL. Some primitives are 
  system dependent for performance reasons. Some drivers (window and device based) use system functions to optimally 
  implement the primitives. Sometimes this implies in a in small different behavior of some functions. Also some 
  primitives do not make sense in some drivers, like server images in file-based drivers.</p>
  <p>The set of available functions is such that it can be implemented in most drivers. Some drivers have sophisticated 
  resources, which cannot be implemented in other drivers but can be made available using a generic attribute 
  mechanism.
  </p>

<h3><a name="buildapp">Building Applications</a></h3>

  <p>All the CD functions are declared in the <tt>cd.h</tt> header file; World Coordinate functions are declared in the
  <tt>wd.h</tt> header file; and each driver has a correspondent header file that must be included to create a canvas. 
  It is important to include each driver header <u>after</u> the inclusion of the <tt>cd.h</tt> header file.</p>
  <p>To link the application you must add the <b>&quot;cd</b>&quot; library. If statically 
  linking then you will need at least the&nbsp; <b>
	&quot;freetype&quot; and the &quot;zlib&quot; </b> libraries. If you use 
  an IUP Canvas then you must also link with the <b>&quot;iupcd&quot;</b> library 
	available in the IUP distribution. Other drivers may need additional 
  secondary libraries.</p>
  <p>In UNIX, CD uses GDK or the Xlib (X11) libraries. To statically link an application in UNIX 
  with CD, add also the GDK or the X11 libraries.</p>
  <p>The download files list includes the <a href="download_tips.html">Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Library 
  Download Tips</a> document, with a description of all the available binaries.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="buildlib">Building the Library</a> </h3>

<p>In the Downloads you will be able to find pre-compiled binaries for many 
platforms, all those binaries were built using Tecmake. Tecmake is a command line multi compiler build tool 
based on GNU make, available at
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake</a>. Tecmake is 
  used by all the Tecgraf libraries and many applications.</p>
<p>You do not need to install Tecmake, scripts for Posix and Windows systems are already included in the source code package. Just type &quot;make&quot; 
in the command line on the main folder and all libraries and executables will be 
build.</p>
<p>In Linux, check the &quot;<a href="building.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Linux</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>In Windows, check the &quot;<a href="buildwin.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Window</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>If you decide to install Tecmake, the Tecmake configuration 
files (*.mak) are available at the &quot;src&quot; folder, and are very easy to understand. 
In the<b> </b>main folder, and in each source folder, there are files 
named 
<i>make_uname.bat</i> that build the libraries using <b>Tecmake</b>. To build 
for Windows using Visual C 9.0 (2008) for example, just execute <i>&quot;make_uname 
vc9&quot;</i> in the iup main folder, or for the DLLs type <i>
&quot;make_uname dll9&quot;</i>. The Visual Studio workspaces with the respective projects 
available in the source package is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p>Make sure you have all the dependencies for the library you want installed, 
see the documentation bellow.</p>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, 
the makefiles and projects expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>\mylibs\
        cd\
        im\
        lua5.1\</pre>
<p>To control that location set the TECTOOLS_HOME environment variable to the 
folder were the IM and Lua libraries are installed.</p>

(*) In Windows, &quot;<strong>cdwin</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdgdiplus</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;. 
    In Linux and BSD &quot;<strong>cdgdk+cdcairo</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdxrender</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;. 
    In IRIX, AIX and SunOS &quot;<strong>cdx11</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdxrender</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;.</pre>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies and included third party 
libraries): CD has NO external dependencies, and CDLua depends on Lua and IMLua. 
Just notice that not all CDLua libraries depend on IMLua.</p>
<p>The Lua bindings for IUP, CD and IM (Makefiles and Pre-compiled binaries) 
depend on the <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> 
distribution. So if you are going to build from source, then use the <strong>LuaBinaries</strong> 
source package also, not the <strong>Lua.org</strong> original source package. 
If you like to use another location for the Lua files define LUA_SUFFIX, LUA_INC, 
LUA_LIB and LUA_BIN before using Tecmake.</p>
<p>To build the driver with GTK 3.x support define USE_GTK3=Yes before calling 
make in the &quot;cd/src&quot; folder. Just the main library must be rebuilt. </p>
<p>In Ubuntu you will need to install the following packages:</p>
<pre>libfreetype6-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev (for the ftgl library used by CD_GL)
libgtk2.0-dev (for the GDK driver)
or
libgtk3.0-dev (for the GTK driver)
  libx11-dev (for the X11 driver, OPTIONAL)
  libxpm-dev (&quot;)
  libxmu-dev (&quot;) 
  libxft-dev (for the XRender driver, OPTIONAL)</pre>

<h3><a name="Environment">Environment Variables</a></h3>

  <p><font face="Courier New"><b>CDDIR</b></font> - This environment variable is used by some drivers to locate useful 
  data files, such as font definition files. It contains the directory path without the final slash.<br>
  <font face="Courier New"><b>CD_QUIET</b></font> - In UNIX, if this variable is defined, it does not show the library's 
  version info on <em>sdtout</em>.<br>
  <font face="Courier New"><b>CD_</b></font><b><font face="Courier New">XERROR</font></b> - In UNIX, if this variable is 
  defined, it will show the X-Windows error messages on <em>sdterr</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="NewDriver">Implementing a Driver</a></h3>

  <p>The best way to implement a new driver is based on an existing one. For this reason, we provide 
  a code of the 
  simplest driver possible, see <a href="../download/cdxx.h">CDXX.H</a> and <a href="../download/cdxx.c">CDXX.C</a>. 
  But first you should read the <a href="internal.html">Internal Architecture</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Play">Intercepting Primitives</a></h3>

  <p>To fill data structures of library primitives during a <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font> call you must 
  implement a driver and activate it before calling <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font>. Inside your driver 
  primitives you can fill your data structure with the information interpreted by the <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font> 
  function.</p>

<h3><a name="IUP">IUP Compatibility</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>IupCanvas</strong> element of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> 
  interface toolkit can be used as a visualization surface for a CD canvas. There are two moments in which one must be 
  careful when an application is using both libraries: when creating the CD canvas, and when changing the size of the 
  IUP canvas.</p>
  <h4>Creating the CD Canvas</h4>
  
    <p>The CD_IUP driver parameter needs only the Ihandle* of the <strong>
	IupCanvas</strong>. But <strong>cdCreateCanvas</strong> must be called <u>after</u> the <strong>IupCanvas</strong> element has been 
    mapped into the native system.</p>
    <p>But a call to <strong>IupShow</strong> generates an ACTION callback. And a 
	direct call to <strong>IupMap</strong> can generate a RESIZE_CB callback.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>So the best way to create a CD canvas for a IUP canvas is to use the
	<strong>IupCanvas</strong> MAP_CB callback. This callback will be always called before 
	any other callback.</p>
    
    <p>The application must be linked with the <strong>iupcd</strong> 
    library that it is available in the IUP package.</p>
  
  <h4>Resizing the IUP Canvas</h4>
  
    <p>When a IupCanvas is resized the CD canvas must be notified of the size 
	change. To do that simply call <strong>cdCanvasActivate</strong> in the 
	RESIZE_CB callback.</p>
