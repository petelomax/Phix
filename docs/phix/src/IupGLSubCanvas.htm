            Creates an embedded OpenGL sub-canvas. It exists only inside an <a href="IupGLCanvasBox.htm">IupGLCanvasBox</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            For more information on the attributes and data parameters see <a href="IupSetAttributes.htm">IupSetAttributes</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is an additional control that depends on the OpenGL library. It is included in the IupGLControls library.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is a void element that does not map to a native canvas. <br>
            It mimics an IupCanvas with several attributes and callbacks in common, but everything is done inside a region of the <a href="IupGLCanvasBox.htm">IupGLCanvasBox</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The element does not have to be a direct child of the <a href="IupGLCanvasBox.htm">IupGLCanvasBox</a>. It can be placed inside void containers like IupHbox, IupVbox, IupGridBox and so on.
            <br>
            <br>
            This control is used as the base control for all visual elements of the IupGLControls library.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: the identifier of the created element.

            FTGL is used to draw text in OpenGL. <br>
            This is a third party library not developed at Tecgraf. <br>
            But its license is also free and have the same freedom as the Tecgraf Library License. <br>
            You can read the FTGL license and copyright in the technicalia dropdown below. FTGL is copyright to Henry Maddocks.
            <br>
            <br>
            IUP uses the same FTGL library included in the CD library. Currently CD is using the FTGL version 2.1.3-rc5 with modifications.
            <br>
            <br>
            To locate font files we use several strategies.
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
            <li>search for the font in the system. In Windows use the Registry to locate the font, in UNIX use the FontConfig library; </li>
            <li>use the type face as a file title, compose with the font path to get a filename (assume style already in the typeface); </li>
            <li>try some pre-defined names, and use the style to compose the filename; </li>
            <li>use the typeface directly as the file name; </li>
            </ol>
            It will search for TrueType (*.ttf) and OpenType (*.otf) font files. It will search in the current directory; 
            in the path returned by the FREETYPEFONTS_DIR environment variable or from the FREETYPEFONTS_DIR global attribute; 
            and in Windows on the Fonts folder.
            <br>
            <br>
            FTGL fonts are cached internally to optimal use of multiple fonts in the same <a href="IupGLCanvasBox.htm">IupGLCanvasBox</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            We use OpenGL textures to draw images, so the image width and height MUST be a power of two if OpenGL version is 1.x, modern OpenGL does not have this limitation.
