            This function returns a CURLM handle to be used as input to all the other multi-functions, 
            sometimes referred to as a multi handle in some places in the documentation. <br>
            This init call MUST have a corresponding call to <a href="curl_multi_cleanup.htm">curl_multi_cleanup</a> when the operation is complete.
            <br>
            <br>
<!--
            Return value: If this function returns NULL, something went wrong and you cannot use the other curl functions.
-->
            Returns a multi handle. <br>
            A fatal error occurs if something goes wrong. <br>
            Legacy code may check for NULL, but that is no longer necessary and the equivalent processing should instead be performed 
            via <a href="try.htm">exception handling</a>, if at all - in general phix takes the perhaps rather stern view that a brutal 
            crash both gives clues and forces a fix, whereas quietly ignoring errors (certainly as opposed to handling them properly)
            can <i>only</i> lead to frustration, irritation, and annoyance.
