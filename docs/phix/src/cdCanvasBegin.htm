            Starts defining a polygon to be drawn (or filled) according to the mode:  CD_CLOSED_LINES, CD_OPEN_LINES, CD_FILL, CD_CLIP, CD_REGION or CD_BEZIER. 
            <ul>
            <li>CD_OPEN_LINES: connects all the points at cdEnd. Depends on line width and line style attributes. </li>
            <li>CD_CLOSED_LINES: connects all the points at cdEnd and connects the last point to the first.  Depends on line width and line style attributes. </li>
            <li>CD_FILL: connects the last point to the first and fills the resulting polygon according to the current interior style. 
                         When the interior style CD_HOLLOW is defined the it behaves as if the mode were CD_CLOSED_LINES. </li>
            <li>CD_CLIP: instead of creating a polygon to be drawn, creates a polygon to define a polygonal clipping region. </li>
            <li>CD_BEZIER: defines the points of a bezier curve. There must be at least 4 points: start, control, control and end. 
                           To specify a sequence of curves use 3 more points for each curve: control, control, end, control, control, end, ... 
                           The end point is used as start point for the next curve. </li>
            <li>CD_REGION: starts the creation of a complex region for clipping. 
                           All calls to cdBox, cdSector, cdChord, Filled Polygons and <a href="cdCanvasText.htm">cdText</a> will be composed in a region for clipping. 
                           See Regions documentation. </li>
            <li>CD_PATH: creates a path composed of several primitives that can be line draw, filled or used as clipping. 
                         Must call cdCanvasPathSet to configure the action between sequences of cdCanvasVertex. </li>
            </ul>
            Open, Closed and Filled Polygons

            Do not create embedded polygons, that is, do not call function cdCanvasBegin twice without a call to cdCanvasEnd in between.
