            If two (or more) threads update a shared variable simultaneously the result will not be as desired. 
            While there are some atomic (lock) operations, you would certainly not want to run normal software
            using them where they are not needed, as they can easily be 30 times slower than the equivalent
            non-locked instructions. Modern pipelined processors offer huge performance benefits over those of
            a decade or more ago, but that means a read-update-write [such as i+=1, ie load i, add 1, store i,
            and you should understand that a single instruction such as add [i],1 actually gets decomposed into 
            similar microinstructions by the cpu itself] gets spread out over more clock cycles. 
            Without any locking, if one thread increments an integer at the same time as another decrements it, 
            or more accurately the 14 or more clock cycles such instructions spend in their pipelines overlap,
            the result could easily be +/-1 the original value rather than the desired net effect of 0.
            If two or more threads were to simultaneously access the same <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a>, 
            when one or both were re-sizing/re-locating it, the outcome would be unpredictable to say the least. 
            Using a critical section briefly pauses execution while any such conflicts exist, with minimal overhead.
            <br>
            <br>
            The critical section, if provided, should have previously been created using init_cs().
            <br>
            <br>
            If the parameter is omitted, an internal one ("stdcs") is used. This is appropriate for things like
            the initialisation in printf(), but might cause excessive waiting or even deadlock in other cases,
            that is if you try to use the single internal default to lock two or more logically distinct things. 
            Accidentally initialising and leaving a private critical section variable set to 0 would obviously 
            have the same consequences.
            <br>
            <br>
            Care must be taken to avoid <b>lock order inversion</b>. When using multiple synchronization objects 
            such as locks, it is vital to respect lock order. When acquiring more than one lock at a time, you 
            must define an implicit precedence that is sometimes called a lock hierarchy or lock order. 
            For example, if lock A is acquired before lock B somewhere in the code, and lock B is acquired before 
            lock C elsewhere in the code, then the lock order is A, B, C and this order must always be followed 
            throughout the code. Lock order inversion occurs when the locking order is not followed — for example, 
            if lock B is acquired before lock A. Lock order inversion can cause deadlocks that are difficult to 
            debug. To avoid such problems, all threads must acquire locks in the same order.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that shared literal constants (such as "hello") may need to be referenced inside a critical
            section because of the shared hidden refcount updates, as per integer updates described above. See 
            builtins\VM\pprntfN.e, routines Nan() and Inf(), for one possible thread-safe alternative. You may 
            also want to consider a "deep_copy" (see builtins\VM\pDeleteN.e for one possible way) to create 
            thread-specific instances of values that would not then require any subsequent locking. Mind you, 
            calls to said "deep_copy" might need locking to avoid refcount issues, in the first place. Plus
            of course it makes no sense to store thread-specific instances of anything in a shared list.
            Note that <a href="deep_copy.htm">deep_copy</a>() does not produce thread-safe atoms and strings.

            Note the use of newtask = 0 in the main thread; this avoids incidental refcount updates outside the critical section.
            In contrast the worker thread is the sole owner (only reference) to the newtask by the time it reaches the leave_cs().
            You may also need similar lines in the main thread to remove other references to elements of newtask, which would be
            valid any time before the leave_cs() and indeed before the enter_cs(), if you were to prefer that.
