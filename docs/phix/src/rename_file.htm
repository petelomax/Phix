            If dest contains a path specification, it is equivalent to moving the file, as well as 
            possibly changing its name. However, the path must exist and be on the same drive.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unlike some other routines here, any path separators should be appropriate for the operating
            system, namely backslash ('\\') on Windows and forwardslash ('/') on Linux.
            <br>
            <br>
            For best results, use fully qualified absolute pathnames. You should not rely on relative
            paths in dest any more than you do in src; for instance rename_file("demo\\test","demo\\test2")
            is fine, whereas rename_file("demo\\test","test2") is likely to move it up a directory, and
            rename_file("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Phix\\demo\\test","test2") is likely to move it to the
            current directory. The precise behaviour of path-less operations is operating system dependent.
            <br>
            <br>
            If overwrite was requested but the rename fails, there is no guarantee that any 
            existing destination file is preserved, deleted, corrupted, or all three.
            <br>
            <br>
            The use of a <a href="procedures.htm#namedparams">named parameter</a> when setting the overwrite flag is recommended, 
            to make the intent clear and the code easier to read.
