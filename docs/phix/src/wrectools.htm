         - Much better than the standard windows (7) search facilities, however, even for me, several months can pass by between two uses of this.

           id="ext102" style="color:#9B5565" >CCleaner</a>
         - Helps keep your computer running smoothly. I typically run this about once every other month.

           id="ext103" style="color:#9B5565" >Dependency Walker</a>
         - Explore windows dll files. I remember this once being an absolute godsend, however I rarely use it anymore.
        <br>

        <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext104','http://greenfishsoftware.blogspot.hu/2012/07/greenfish-icon-editor-pro.html');"

         - Pretty decent icon editor.

           id="ext105" style="color:#9B5565" >HTML Help Workshop From Microsoft</a>
         - just the command line hhc part (Htmlhelp.exe), needed to rebuild help (.chm) files.

        <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext106','https://www.amazon.co.uk/clouddrive/share/exnHz9XAdV8LboH2h2lB62sW8Tq5NwJVOsLKwaG7QuW');"
           id="ext106" style="color:#9B5565" >mini.chm</a>
         - My repackage of the MSDN windows API reference (48MB), which integrates quite nicely with Edita.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext107','http://www.ollydbg.de/');"
           id="ext107" style="color:#9B5565" >OllyDbg</a>
         - 32 bit windows debugger. This and/or FDBG a must for debugging low-level inline assembly such as the Phix runtime.
        <br>

           id="ext108" style="color:#9B5565" >Process Monitor</a>
         - See what programs are really getting up to, in terms of file i/o, group policy permissions, registry and network access, etc. Historically, I have needed this
        almost daily when coding in C++, a bit when coding in assembly (occasionally including the back end parts of Phix), and almost never when coding in (hll) Phix.
        Actually there was a fairly recent need: monitoring attempts to load the IUP dlls (that I had just downloaded) proved to be extremely helpful.
        On Linux you can try running <code>strace -s99999 -efile command_name</code> to obtain similar details.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite recent problems, I am still quite the fan of Avast and Opera, but hand on heart I cannot really recommend either anymore. To be fair, Avast has recently
        turned the corner and is now slowly regaining my trust, but it still has a little further to go yet.
