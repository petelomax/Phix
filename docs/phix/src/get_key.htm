         <td>The operating system can hold a small number of key-hits in its 
             keyboard buffer. get_key() will return the next one from the buffer, 
             or -1 if the buffer is empty.

<!-- DEV (key.bat) -->
            Run the
           <font color="#5500FF">
            <b>key.bat</b>
           </font> program to see what key code is generated for each key on your keyboard.

            Note that get_key() is for console applications only and usually has <i>no place whatsoever</i> in a gui application.
            It can only catch keystrokes when the console (assuming you have one) has focus; when the gui has focus then the gui
            absorbs any keystrokes, as you should expect - for example see <a href="callbacks.htm#K_ANY">K_ANY</a>.
