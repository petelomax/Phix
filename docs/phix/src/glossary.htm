        Let me know of anything else that should be clarified here, or anything that needs further simplification for those
        completely new to computers and programming, obviously within reason and assuming they have access to several other 
        sources of educational material. Of particular importance are any words and phrases used elsewhere in this document
        and/or the sources of Phix that might be slightly ambiguous.

            The simple act of giving something a clear and intuitive name. Often this term is explained in the most baroque, 
            confusing, and unhelpful way possible, especially layers within layers to hide and protect things. I would argue 
            it is all about careful choices that will avoid distraction and let you focus on other matters, and that the real 
            benefits are not usually immediate but months or years from now.

            era
         </td>

            The effective return address, a low-level implementation detail of how the debugger actually works. Normally, in day-to-day use of 
            Phix, the era is correctly translated to a hll line number and is of no concern to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Quite often the era is just the same as a usual return address. However, suppose that opApnd invokes opDealloc, and something goes 
            wrong in the latter. Rather than using the real return address into the middle of opApnd, we want an era that can be converted to 
            a hll line number. Or perhaps during the statement s[1][2][3][4][5][6] = x, we might find that s[1][2][3][4] is 0, and need to 
            issue an "attempt to subscript an atom" error when 4 out of 6 subscripts have been processed (popped from the stack). While it may
            have little or no impact on runtime performance, correctly maintaining an era (propagating it through nested calls) may consume a 
            not entirely insignificant amount of effort when modifying the low-level back end. If an error message shows line number -1, your 
            first suspicion should be that some low level code is not getting the era quite right.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that era often have a -1 applied. Consider the following (fictional) listing fragment
            <pre>
                    112     n = <expr>
                                ...
                                call :%pStoreFlt        ;#004020145
                    113     s = t
                                add [ebx+esi*4-16],1    ;#00402014A
            </pre>
            ie pStoreFlt preserves all registers, and the first instruction for line 113, assuming the compiler knows that [t] is already
            in esi and that t is not unassigned, is to increase the reference count on it. If we catch an exception at #402014A, we want
            to point the user at line 113, however if there is a problem in pStoreFlt, then rather than use the actual return address of
            #402014A we use an era of #4020149, to point the error message at line 112. Naturally the above instructions would normally
            work just fine, but if n/t/esi have been corrupted somehow, we need to say something.
            <br>
            <br>
            All memory allocations also have an era stored against them for use in memory leak checking and suchlike.

            When an antivirus(AV) program proclaims there is a problem in a file, but in fact there is nothing wrong with it. 
            The ever increasing rate of malware production has forced AV makers to adopt "heuristic" and "reputation" based 
            mechanisms, with an unavoidable hike in false positives, and is the lastest bane of many a developer. 
            One in particular has caused me problems: Avast/evo-gen. The good news is that once a program "matures", or 
            reaches a certain size, the problem stops. Obviously I report these as and when I see fit, but response times
            are painfully slow. While submission may or may not achieve miracles, not doing so almost guarantees that things 
            will simply <i>never</i> get fixed. See also <a href="rectools.htm">Recommended Tools</a> for links to 
            several on-line scanners, which obviously would not exist if all or even any AV were perfect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the (smaller) included demos have a trailing "--/**/include ..\test\t02parms.exw" or similar as that can 
            make some false positives go away. My hope is that any such measures prove to be temporary.

            Not recommended for general use. An internal compile-time type check. Statements of the form
            #isginfo{name,0b0101,MIN,MAX,integer,-2} are checked at the end of compilation in an attempt
            to ensure a variable is being assigned the right kinds of things and will require the minimum 
            of run-time type-checks. They were introduced to streamline the compiler development, where
            they are still quite widely used, but proved less than spectacularly successful. All too often
            the only sensible way to create a new statement is to copy an existing one and then copy the
            actual details from the resulting compiler error message. They can often trigger in subtle and 
            irrelevant ways and can be extremely difficult to debug. That said, sometimes the compiler ones 
            do indeed catch stupid coding errors in a fairly helpful and immediate manner. There is also a
            full (t49, 800+ lines) test file, run as part of p -test, dedicated entirely to #isginfo{}.
            By the time you know enough to use these in anger, you won&rsquo;t need me to tell you what 
            each of the individual fields mean, and if you have to ask you&rsquo;re probably not ready.

            The command line -lint option is not formally supported. It performs a few extra 
            checks which may be helpful, but if anything untoward happens my advice is simply 
            going to be "well, don't use -lint then".
            <br>
            <br>
            When you compile a program, some extra analysis takes place which gives scope for 
            a few more error messages. By far the biggest use of the internal flag behind the
            -lint option is to make an interpret perform the same checks as a compile, and 
            obviously that is not massively helpful - you may as well just use -c instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            Otherwise, -lint causes additional warnings when files are auto-included, routines
            are implicitly forward referenced, or when functions may modify something being
            modified on return, and disables "without warning". Occasionally implicit forward 
            references can go wrong (especially wrt local/global assumptions) and adding the
            appropriate include/explicit forward declarations can help. Sometimes a statement
            such as "table[i] = modify_table()" is going to use an outdated index when the
            function call returns, and of course a misjudged "without warning" may be hiding
            something you really ought to see.
            <br>
            <br>
            More often than not, "fixing" such messages will achieve absolutely nothing.
            Wasting time getting a "clean lint" is unlikely to be very productive, except for
            ensuring that the next time you use -lint it only shows new findings.

            This is most useful when a particular global identifier occurs in more than one file, but might just be there to clarify intent.
            Traditionally a namespace is declared using "as &lt;namespace&gt;" on an include statement, but it can also be declared at the start
            of the included file. Note that a namespace is always deemed local rather than global and may therefore require a source file to be
            re-included by any source files that want to qualify a reference with it. See <a href="scope.htm">scope</a>.

            The term scope is a general concept used when describing how the compiler resolves references to identifiers. In most cases it
            is simple and intuitive, involving nothing more than plain old common sense. The scope of an identifier is where, in terms of 
            which lines of code, it can be referenced. The scope of a variable starts at the point of declaration and ends at the end of 
            the declaring block, routine, file, or in the case of globals, on the last line of the main file. The scope of a routine is 
            anywhere in the file it is declared in, or in the case of global routines, anywhere in the entire application. Namespaces and
            explicit forward declarations can be used to further qualify and clarify matters. See <a href="scope.htm">scope</a>.

            A variable-length array of 8-bit characters/bytes/integers with values from 0 to 255. Strings can be stored in 
            variables declared as
          <a href="html/glossary.htm#sequence">sequence</a>, however variables declared as string
          <i>
           <b>cannot</b>
          </i> hold a
          <a href="#dwordseq">dword-sequence</a>.
            Strings can also be used to hold raw binary data, though you would normally use allocate() for that. Likewise
            unicode text other than UTF8 is normally best kept in raw memory or a <a href="#dwordseq">dword-sequence</a>.

            When I use tbyte, I really mean ten-byte, ie an 80-bit float. This is the same meaning as FASM, and has been
            copied into the inline assembler of Phix. Thankfully it does not cause any known conflicts, but in the crazy 
            C/C++-land, tbyte or TBYTE is often used to mean "an 8 or 16-bit byte" (I kid thee not).
            We are probably all wrong.

            this document end with a technicalia drop-down. They are initially hidden to avoid breaking the flow of my 
            (or more acurately Rob Craig&rsquo;s) otherwise achingly beautiful prose. <img src="images/ksk-smile.png" /> 
            They can be skipped on first reading, may help when you hit a difficult problem, and above all are not worth 
            getting all hot and bothered about, he says hopefully.

            Internal compiler/back-end term. Routine parameters, local variables, and any unnamed temporaries required
            inside a routine are all tvars. They are stored relative to ebp, with storage for them created by opFrame
            and destroyed by opRetf, see the comments in builtins/VM/pStack.e for more details.
            See also/contrast with gvar. Note that while gvars can have an associated compile-time value for constant
            and assignment-on-declaration purposes, that is not the case for tvars, which only have run-time values.

            An international standard for holding non-ascii text. Phix source files may be stored as UTF8 (but not UTF16)
            and Edita can edit UTF8/16 files seamlessly, as long as they begin with a proper BOM. Note that UTF8 string 
            characters can be difficult to process using normal subscripts; since unicode characters can be composed of 
            more than one byte, the third character (for instance) is not necessarily stored at s[3]. However substring
            matching, and subsequent replacement, generally works perfectly well, without any known issues.

            The term Virtual Machine has several meanings in the computer world; quite commonly it is used for a software 
            imitation of an entire operating system running inside another. However in Phix it is simply a collection of 
            software components that augment the physical hardware and wrap many (but not all) OS-specific requirements. 
            These components can be found in the builtins\VM directory. For example the hardware add can only operate on
            two integers and fadd on two floats, whereas :%opAdd (in builtins\VM\pMath.e) can operate on any combination 
            of integer and float, and yield either an integer or floating point result.

            When I use "word", I usually mean a 16-bit value (and dword/qword for 32/64 bits). Many academic papers use 
            it to mean "machine word", which of course these days means "32 or 64 depending on how you compiled it", as
            opposed to the physical hardware.
