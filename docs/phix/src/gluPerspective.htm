            The gluPerspective function sets up a perspective projection matrix.
            <br>
            <br>
            fovy: The field of view angle, in degrees, in the y-direction.<br>
            aspect: The aspect ratio that determines the field of view in the x-direction. The aspect ratio is the ratio of x (width) to y (height).<br>
            zNear: The distance from the viewer to the near clipping plane (always positive).<br>
            zFar: The distance from the viewer to the far clipping plane (always positive).<br>
         </td>
        </tr>

          <b>Remarks</b>
         </td>
         <td>
            The gluPerspective function specifies a viewing frustum into the world coordinate system. <br>
            In general, the aspect ratio in gluPerspective should match the aspect ratio of the associated viewport. <br>
            For example, aspect = 2.0 means the viewer&rsquo;s angle of view is twice as wide in x as it is in y. <br>
            If the viewport is twice as wide as it is tall, it displays the image without distortion.
            <br>
            <br>
            The matrix generated by gluPerspective is multiplied by the current matrix, just as if glMultMatrix were called with the generated matrix. <br>
            To load the perspective matrix onto the current matrix stack instead, precede the call to gluPerspective with a call to glLoadIdentity.
