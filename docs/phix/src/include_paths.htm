            Returns a list of include paths, which are typically searched last-first.
            <br>
            <br>
            The convert parameter is unused and present solely for compatibility with OpenEuphoria.

            The list returned is in reverse order of searching, potentially with inactive relative directory handling towards the end.
            For example if an application contains &lsquo;include ..\..\demo\arwen\arwen.ew&rsquo; the appropriate fully resolved
            path to arwen.ew is added to the end of the include paths table so that any include statements within that file are
            searched for within that path first, and that path is marked inactive once arwen.ew has been fully processed. Several
            such events may have occurred during compilation; the table returned is the complete table as at the end of compilation, 
            but without any indication of which, if any, directories are no longer 'active'.
            <br>
            <br>
            As shown below, every entry of the result ends with a path separator, so there should be no need to check for that.
            <br>
            <br>
            If EUDIR and/or EUINC are defined, they appear at the start of the list, and therefore would be searched last.
            <br>
            <br>
            The include_path() function (without an s) is actually an auxillary function for the common case of wanting just one entry 
            from the with-an-s set. Multiple trailing directories can be specified as either eg "builtins\\VM" or {"builtins","VM"}.
            Obviously, for compile-time type errors on the parameter, check the s.<br>
            Note there is no equivalent routine in OpenEuphoria (not that it would be difficult to add/work around).

          The result is <b><i>not</i></b> thread safe, and may corrupt internal reference counts when freed, if that occurs in multiple threads.<br>
          Ideally this routine should only ever be called from the main/gui thread, and perhaps kept for the entire duration of an application.
