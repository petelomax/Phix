      <div id="mainSection">
[DRAFT/DUMPING-GOUND]
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        pGUI-IDE is intended to help both beginners getting started and ease the pain of the more trivial 
        dialogs for more advanced users. It is not intended to be particularly helpful on more complex or
        dynamic layouts and dialogs. Also, many applications are just a single canvas on a single dialog,
        and you should not be too surprised or disappointed when that is exactly what this (only) shows.
        <br>
        <br>
        Often little tricks on the main dialog make it much slicker, and it is fairly unlikely that such
        a simple utility as this can keep up. It is however fair to say that pGUI-IDE is more likely to 
        shine on the secondary rarely-used screens than the main - and in fact that is intentionally so.
        One argument says that you shouldn't need as much help with the screens that you know the best.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pretty much the sole aim here is to get the containers/fillers/padding/expansion/gaps/margins
        all worked out. For everything else (especially images) you really need to see the finished
        application running to see if you got it right. More than anything else, though, you are not
        supposed to spend much time in pGUI-IDE, but rather more often just a quick in/fix/out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially I planned to support menus fully, but realised it is probably easier to do most of
        the necessary in plain text. Anyway, I still load them, but they are not editable in here.
        <br>
        <br>
<hr>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        pGUI-IDE is <b>strongly</b> biased towards beginner/static/mundane/secondary windows. As a
        dialogue gets ever more complicated and fancy, with dynamic/optional/alternative execution paths, the
        limitations of pGUI-IDE will increasingly show, until eventually pGUI-IDE will simply not 
        be able to cope with that window at all. This is intentional and entirely expected.
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the most important point here is the unsupported nature of constructs such as:
<!--eucode>
    IHandle ih
    if <some condition> then
        ih = IupThis()
    else
        ih = IupThat()
    end if
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000">    IHandle ih
</font><font color="#008080">    if</font><font color="#0000FF"> &lt;</font><font color="#000000">some condition</font><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font><font color="#008080"> then
</font><font color="#000000">        ih</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#000000"> IupThis</font><font color="#0000FF">()
</font><font color="#008080">    else
</font><font color="#000000">        ih</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#000000"> IupThat</font><font color="#0000FF">()
</font><font color="#008080">    end if</font>
</pre>
        pGUI-IDE makes no special attempt to show one or the other, or both, and will typically
        reject the code with a message such as "ih unresolved on line 751". Sometimes it may be
        possible to tweak things until pGUI-IDE can cope, but that is the programmer&rsquo;s
        responsibility.
        <br>
        <br>
        The flip-side is that making the output of the pGUI-IDE first draft as standard code means 
        that you <i>can</i> enhance it beyond the capabilities of pGUI-IDE, as opposed to hiding
        things away in a special format/file that you might later struggle to amend.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note however that if you do something like this:
<!--eucode>
    IHandle right
    if SHOWDETAILS then
        right = IupSplit(hierarchytree,properties)
    else
        right = hierarchytree
    end if
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000">    IHandle right
</font><font color="#008080">    if</font><font color="#000000"> SHOWDETAILS</font><font color="#008080"> then
</font><font color="#000000">        right</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#5E005E"> IupSplit</font><font color="#0000FF">(</font><font color="#000000">hierarchytree</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000">properties</font><font color="#0000FF">)
</font><font color="#008080">    else
</font><font color="#000000">        right</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#000000"> hierarchytree
</font><font color="#008080">    end if</font>
</pre>
        Then pGUI-IDE will simply ignore the else part (whatever SHOWDETAILS is set to) and always show the IupSplit.<br>
        In that way you can get the best of both worlds: something which is a bit more dynamic/configurable, but can
        still be edited with pGUI-IDE.

<hr>
        As a dialog becomes ever more complicated/dynamic/configurable or even platform-specific, it
        will outgrow pGUI-IDE, which cannot be expected to keep up with every little trick programmers
        use to make their fancy application (/main screen) ever more slick. For a laugh, open google
        and find the view source option of the browser ( credit to 
        <a href="javascript:ExternalLink('ext001','https://xkcd.com/1605');"
               id="ext001" style="color:#9B5565" >xkcd/DNA</a>).
<hr>
        There is an implicit assumption that you would never want to drag/drop an element to
        a sibling of an empty container. In some cases you might need to add a dummy element
        to an empty branch, collapse it, drag the sibling into place, and then remove the
        no-longer-needed dummy element.
<hr>
        Sometimes you might for instance want to add an IupCalendar to an IupFrame, only to be told you cannot,
        probably because the frame already has a child, and it can only have one. The only containers that can
        have more than one child are IupHbox, IupVbox, IupCbox, IupGridBox, IupNormaliser, IupTabs amd IupZbox,
        plus I suppose IupSlit which always takes exactly 2. All the others, including IupDialog, IupDetachBox,
        IupFrame, IupRadio, etc, can only have one child.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes you can add that IupCalendar as a sibling, then add the required IupHbox, and then drag the 
        IupCalendar into place, while at other times you may be forced to cancel the operation, and add that
        IupHbox first (probably using the "parent" mode from the drop-down).
<hr>
        Note that drag and drop in the hierarchy tree is highly dependent on the EXPANDED/COLLAPSED state of
        the drop target. If the latter is expanded then the dragged item is made the first child, whereas if
        it is collapsed then it is made the next sibling. Therefore you must always ensure the destination
        node is in the correct expanded/collapsed state, before commencing the drag operation.
<hr>
        Actually, IupDestroy(IupNormaliser()) <i>should</i> be siblings of IupDialog - iff &gt;=1(/verify that
        <i>ALL</i>) elements are indeed children of said.
<hr>
        If you right click anywhere on the properties frame, a menu appears offering to edit the currently 
        selected item from the properties list. It is usually easier just to double-click on the property; 
        if truth be told that menu only exists as a replacement for the Container/Element popup, since it 
        would be very confusing were that to appear when right-clicking on the properties panel.
<hr>
        The confirm insert dialog appears:
        &lt;image&gt;
        The top centre drop-down can contain child, sibling, and parent, depending on whether the new and
        target items are containers or elements, and whether the target and parent of target are already 
        full. Note that several containers can only have one child (IupDialog, IupFrame, IupRadio, IupSbox, 
        IupBackgroundBox, IupDetachBox, IupExpander, IupScrollBox, IupSpinBox), and IupSplit can only have 
        two. Should it not be possible to insert the new item anywhere in the vicinity of the target, then
        rather than showing a crippled confirm insert dialog, with the (empty) dropdown and ok buttons
        disabled, the following error is shown: &lt;image&gt;
<hr>
        IupMessage("Invalid","""
________The target element cannot have any [more] elements, so you cannot add a child,
        and its parent is full, so you cannot add a sibling, and the selected element is not
        a container, or the target is the main IupDialog, so you cannot make it a parent. 

        Right-clicking on or when the main IupDialog is selected usually displays a menu
        with all no-entry icons - try clicking on a sub-element, or add more containers, 
        most commonly IupHbox and IupVbox.
        
        This message is explained in more detail right at the start of the manual.""")
<hr>
        Should only one of child/sibling/parent be valid, then it is automatically selected and the OK
        button enabled. When more than one is valid, it forces one to be selected and the OK button is 
        disabled until that happens. The initial focus is on the drop-down or OK button accordingly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that before all this happens, any invalid entries on the Containers/Elements menu are 
        given a no-entry icon - and the IupDialog entry is pretty much always in that state. The key
        thing to understand is that IupHbox and IupVbox, in particular, plus IupCbox, IupGridBox, and 
        IupZbox, are necessary but otherwise invisible mediators that allow complex dialogs to be 
        constructed. The only other one of note is IupTabs, but that is not so invisible. All those
        containers listed above, that can only take one child, almost always get either an IupHbox 
        or an IupVbox, and in that way mutiple grand-children are not only allowed but also laid out
        in the required manner.
<hr>
        When you move the mouse over the livedisplay, it auto-selects the corresponding entry in the 
        hierarchy tree after a short delay (0.2s). Clicking on an element works more immediately and
        then sets that delay to a whole second. Note that hovering the mouse achieves nothing - only 
        move or click events will ever actually make anything happen. There are a few cases where it
        gets mildly annoying, eg it is very easy to switch tabs and then move the mouse too quickly,
        but the tiniest of nudges, or a quick click, should sort it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        The short delay allows you to get the mouse off the live display without selecting things on 
        the way to the edge, and/or having to re-select things from the hierarchy tree again.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also note that non-visible elements such as IupHbox and <a href="IupFill.htm">IupFill</a> 
        are never auto-selected, and
        in particular there are quite simply are no "IupTabItem" elements on an IupTabs which can be 
        auto-selected, no matter how much you and I might want or expect there to be - instead each
        and every tab just auto-selects the exact same IupTabs container, even when clicked. There
        is, thankfully, no such problem auto-selecting elements within the currently open tab.
        <br>
        <br>
        It should be enough that auto-select easily and quickly gets you in roughly the right area,
        and obviously that could be a significant time-saving, for hierechy trees with hundreds of
        nodes and a fair few levels of nesting.
<hr>
        For instance, pGUI-IDE can only cope with the source of pGUI-IDE because I tweaked it until
        it could. There were several things like multiple Ihandle vbox; renaming them as vboxws (for
        window selection) and vboxci (for confirm insert) made pGUI-IDE much happier. Another one
        was that <code>info = IupLabel(); IupSetStrAttribute(info,"TITLE",fmt,args)</code> worked
        much better than <code>string itxt = sprintf(fmt,args); info = IupLabel(itxt)</code>. The
        fact remains that pGUI-IDE will always fare better on new/small "leaf sources", especially
        those ones that are not significantly altered from what pGUI-IDE did or would have created 
        itself, rather than the main cruft-filled and/or heavily hand-modified source files.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are also a couple of modifications to demo\pGUI\frame.exw that made it work much
        better with pGUI-IDE, the second of which became unnecessary. Perhaps in the future it
        could be made to cope with "&" and "substitute()", or maybe pretend-resolve as "???"....
<hr>
        I have deliberately aimed for a fail fast/fragile/brittle core that errors out asap...
<hr>
        Obviously the livedisplay is "inert" - no button or menu entry is ever going to do anything
        when clicked on, and of course it is entirely unsuitable for any actual testing, such as
        whether various elements are correctly enabled/disabled or even visible during use (I only
        mention that because sometimes it can be easy to forget, when it feels a bit too lifelike).
<hr>
        Developer/Samples
            For quick testing, and learners. Note that selecting any of these entries puts pGUI-IDE
            into "read-only" mode - you must use Edix/Tools/Layout Editor to save any changes (and
            obviously first open/switch to the file that you want to update).
                The following deserve special mention:
                * GraphR.exw shows how dull a canvas-only app looks in pGUI-IDE.
                * matrix3.exw somewhat over-sells the capabilities of pGUI-IDE on grids/lists/trees; 
                in most cases the grid will be unoccupied, more like 7guis\Cells.exw, and can be 
                completely blank should the number of row/columns be more dynamically set.
                * tabs.exw likewise proves that pGUI-IDE works well on purely static tabs, but the
                depiction of an IupTabs control will quite often be somewhat more mundane.
                * toggle.exw showcases the inability of pGUI-IDE to show images, something also
                evident, in places, in sample.exw and simple_paint.exw
                
//              demo\pGUI\fill.exw
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\GraphR`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\calendar`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\detachbox`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\hbox`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\matrix3`),  -- add a warning (this somewhat over-sells pGUI-IDE on IupMatrix)
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\radio`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\rot13`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\sample`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\simple_notepad`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\simple_paint`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\tabs`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\pGUI\toggle`),   -- add a note regarding images
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\Counter.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\Booker.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\Cells.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\CircleDraw.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\Converter.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\CRUD.exw`),
//                       IupMenuItem(`demo\rosetta\7guis\Timer.exw`)

            The same window appears automatically when pGUI-IDE is run standalone. Note that cancel
            terminates the application, whether or not ...[DEV see what we can do]
            
        Developer/Show expected hierarchy
            Used for bugfixing of pGUI-IDE itself. Typically I take a copy of the output of pGUI-IDE, 
            with SHOWBRANCHINFO set to 1(true), specifically the IupSetAttributeId(hierarchytree,..)
            lines, and plant them in setup_tree(). If I have not added a branch for the current 
            source file name, the menu option will be disabled. I can then tweak those lines until
            I get the tree structure actually desired, before figuring out a way to make the code
            do exactly the same, which proves much easier than trying to do it "blind".
        Developer/Write parse_data.txt
            Can be very useful when debugging pGUI-IDE itself. Earlier versions used to just dump
            this to the console, but that quickly gets completely and utterly impractical, once
            more than 40 or so elements are involved. Obviously the idea is to manually (re-)open
            that file in the editor - it can often remain exactly the same even over several long 
            debugging sessions, plus you might want to(/that way can) add notes to it.
        Developer/Write pGUI-IDE.log
            Shows some of the inner workings of pGUI-IDE. Can also be useful to find out which
            things pGUI-IDE struggles with - for instance see demo\pGUI\frame.exw, which works
            much better in pGUI_IDE since the (clearly marked) removal of "&substitute(".
            Note that eg "[3111]" refers to the source line in pGUI-IDE.exw that printed the
            message, whereas "line 751" refers to the parsed source/your application.
            Note that constants SHOWBRANCHINFO etc in pGUI-IDE.exw control what gets printed.
        Developer/Write updates.lst
            Dumps the list of edits required to the source file. This would normally be passed
            directly to Edix, and ordered last-first. It is also possible for this file to be
            ordered differently, or contain additional links/references [by the obvious method
            of editing the source code of pGUI-IDE.exw].
<hr>
        Targetted squarely at dull/mundane windows...
<hr>
        IupSpin is not supported, since I cannot think of any reason why you would use a raw one rather 
        that use an IupSpinBox, which is supported and contains a (hidden) IupSpin, and in fact I cannot
        think of any reason to use an IupSpinBox instead of an IupText with the SPIN attribute set.
