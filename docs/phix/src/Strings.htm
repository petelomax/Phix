        A character is really just an integer. Individual characters may be specified using
        <i>single</i> quotes, e.g:
<!--eucode>
     'B'
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008000">     'B'</font>
</pre>
        which is completely indistinguishable from the (4 or 8 byte) integer 66, the 
        equivalent ASCII code.
       <br>
       <br>
        Just as integers can be considered an optimised form of atom, strings can be
        considered an optimised form of sequence of character. Strings may be specified
        using
        <i>double quotes</i>, e.g:
<!--eucode>
     "ABCDEFG"
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008000">     "ABCDEFG"</font>
</pre>
        Character strings may be manipulated and operated upon just like any other 
        sequences. For example the above string is equivalent to the 
        <a href="html/glossary.htm#dwordseq">dword-sequence</a>:
<!--eucode>
     {65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71}
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#0000FF">     {</font><font color="#000000">65</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 66</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 67</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 68</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 69</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 70</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> 71</font><font color="#0000FF">}</font>
</pre>
        which contains the corresponding ASCII codes (see technical note below).
       <br>
        <a name=empty_seq></a>
       <br>
        It follows that "" is equivalent to {}. Both represent a sequence of length
        zero, also known as the
        <font color="#030303">
         <b>empty sequence</b>
        </font>. 
        As a matter of programming style, it is natural to use "" to suggest a length
        zero string, and {} to suggest some other kind of sequence.
       <br>
       <br>
        While you can store any string value in a variable declared as a sequence, 
        the reverse is not true.
       <br>
        <a name=char></a>
       <br>
        An
        <b>individual character</b>
        is an
        <b><a href="integer.htm">integer</a></b>. It must be entered using single 
        quotes. There is a difference between an individual character (which is an 
        integer), and a character string of length 1 (which is a sequence), e.g.
<!--eucode>
    'B'   -- equivalent to the integer 66 - the ASCII code for B
    "B"   -- equivalent to the sequence {66}
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008000">    'B'  </font><font color="#000080"><i> -- equivalent to the integer 66 - the ASCII code for B
</i></font><font color="#008000">    "B"  </font><font color="#000080"><i> -- equivalent to the sequence {66}</i></font>
</pre>
        Again, 'B' is just a notation that is equivalent to typing 66. There isn&rsquo;t
        really a "character" in phix, except as part of a string, otherwise individual
        characters are stored as 4 (or 8) byte integers.
       <br>
       <br>
        Tip: ""&ch is just a simple and handy notation for creating a length-1 string from a single character. Obviously it does exactly what it
        says, namely appends a single character to a length-0 string, although admittedly it does look a little Perl-esque. If you prefer, the
        expression ch&"" would also be fine, or extracting s[i..i] is better than extracting s[i] and then having to convert that to a string.
       <br>
       <br>
        Keep in mind that an atom is
        <b>
         <i>not</i>
        </b>
        equivalent to a one-element sequence containing the same value, although there 
        are a few built-in routines that choose to treat them similarly.
       <br>
       <br>
        Special characters may be entered (between quotes) using a back-slash:
 <pre>
       Code     Value   Meaning
        \n       #10     newline
        \r       #13     carriage return
        \b       #08     backspace (phix-only)
        \t       #09     tab
        \\       #5C     backslash
        \"       #22	 double quote
        \'       #27	 single quote
        \0       #00     null
        \e       #1B     escape (ditto \E)
        \#HH     #HH     any hexadecimal byte (phix-only)
        \xHH     #HH     any hexadecimal byte
        \uH4      -      any 16-bit unicode point
        \UH8      -      any 32-bit unicode point
 </pre>
        For example, "Hello, World!\n", or '\\'. By default Edita displays character strings in green. Just as with 
        fractional results converting to floating-point automatically, setting a string element to a non-character 
        value automatically expands it to a <a href="html/glossary.htm#dwordseq">dword-sequence</a>, and if that is
        not desired you are immediately notified in a clear and no-nonsense, human-readable manner.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unicode points may be specified using "\uHHHH" (must be exactly 4 hex digits) and "\UHHHHHHHH" (must be
        exactly 8 hex digits). The compiler automatically converts such to UTF-8, though personally I suspect that
        since the compiler supports UTF-8 source files, it is much easier to do this unicode stuff WYSIWYG-style. 
        Note that you cannot use either \u or \U to specify UTF-16 surrogates, and of course all values outside 
        0..#10FFFF are automatically replaced with the standard invalid character ("\#EF\#BF\#BD" aka #FFFD). 
        Also note that \u and \U are double-quote-only - they cannot be used between single quotes. Plus of course
        that is a general point about unicode characters: just because your episilon-cidilla-umlaut looks like a
        single character, it is in fact a 3-byte string, and therefore cannot be single quoted, even WYSIWYG-style. 
        See also the <a href="utfconv.htm">Unicode Library Routines</a>.
       <blockquote>
        <b>Technical note</b>:
        Internally that string data example ("ABCDEFG") occupies 24 bytes whereas the sequence of (4-byte) integers 
        occupies 48 bytes. On 64-bit, it is 39 vs 96 bytes (see builtins\VM\pHeap.e if you must). On very long 
        strings, the space savings approach 75% (32-bit) or 87.5% (64-bit) and that <i>can</i> lead, in extreme 
        cases such as pointless benchmarks, to a 4 or 8-fold performance improvement.
        Despite such differences, they compare as equal and display the same, and in fact pretty much the only way 
        to tell them apart is with the <code><a href="string.htm">string</a>()</code> builtin.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that strings are byte-subscripted; while theoretically you may store UTF16 data in a string, it is 
        usually easier to store and manipulate such in <a href="html/glossary.htm#dwordseq">dword-sequences</a>. 
        The handling is however completely transparent; you quite simply should not care.
        <br>
        <br>
        This (the "quite simply should not care" part) was hammered home to me when I added 
        Unicode file support to Edita, which I knew made heavy use of 8-bit strings. Obviously 
        I had to change <code>readFile()</code> to detect the unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark) and then read a 
        word instead of a byte for each character, and similar for <code>saveFile().</code> Of course program 
        source files should (must) be ansi or UTF8, not UTF16, it was .reg files that prompted
        me to support the latter (UTF16LE/BE).
        <br>
        <br>
        All the other code, be that display/edit/find/replace/cut/copy/paste/whatever, that had only ever been asked 
        to manipulate 8-bit strings, some of which was 7 or 8 years old by then, all worked seamlessly when I started 
        throwing dword sequences at it, without a single change.
        <br>
        <br>
        Just to avoid being accused of misleading anyone, full unicode support required several other changes, 
        what "worked seamlessly" was ansi in dword sequences. In particular, further changes were needed to use 
        the widestring rather than the ansistring versions of certain windows API routines. Even so, the total 
        number of changes was substantially less than first feared.
        <br>
        <br>
        UPDATE<BR>
        Note, however, that over time the benefits of using the builtin string type are slowly creeping into the
        builtins themselves; for instance chdir just needed a hack because it accepts sequence rather than string,
        so that may change soon, also panykey/pgetpath/scanf/substitute/timedate and timestamp were all written 
        from the get-go using the string type, as was the entire pGUI cross-platform GUI library. On the plus 
        side, it is usually pretty obvious what needs to be done when that sort of typecheck triggers, and
        obviously string-only code can be a fair bit faster and smaller than string-or-dword-sequence code.<br>
        It should also be noted that some conversions may be plain wrong, especially UTF16 held as a 
        <a href="html/glossary.htm#dwordseq">dword-sequence</a> to a byte-truncated string. These will be
        fixed as and when reported, but failing that I would advise immediately converting any such to UTF8.
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <b>Compatibility Note</b> In Phix, \b is used for backspace, whereas (very oddly imo) OpenEuphoria uses it 
        to declare a mid-string binary value, eg "\b01010101" is the same as {#55} or "U", erm, hmmm. I have never
        seen this used, but if it was byte-sized I would immediately convert it to \xHH form (by putting in a 
        leading 0 to make it 0b01010101 and then using Edita\Case\Show as Hex (Ctrl H)). Obviously, on the 
        compatibility front, you should use \x08 instead of \b, and likewise \xHH not \#HH.
        <br>

       </blockquote>
        Strings can also be entered by using triple quotes or backticks intead of double quotes to include linebreaks 
        and avoid any backslash interpretation. (On my keyboard the backtick is between the Esc and Tab keys.)
        If the literal begins with a newline, it is discarded and any immediately following leading underscores 
        specify a (maximum) trimming that should be applied to all subsequent lines. Examples:
<!--eucode>
ts = """
this
string\thing"""

ts = """
_____this
     string\thing"""

ts = `this
string\thing`

ts = "this\nstring\\thing"
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000">ts</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#008000"> """
this
string\thing"""

</font><font color="#000000">ts</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#008000"> """
_____this
     string\thing"""

</font><font color="#000000">ts</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#008000"> `this
string\thing`

</font><font color="#000000">ts</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#008000"> "this\nstring\\thing"</font>
</pre>
        which are all equivalent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tip: if you accidentally start with a quadruple quote instead of a triplequote, then the underscore thing 
        won&rsquo;t work - obviously the compiler treats it as a triplequote followed by a normal single doublequote 
        that does not need escaping, all perfectly valid, so it would be quite wrong for any syntax-colouring or 
        suchlike to suggest any error. I only mention this because it is very easy to assume there is a bug in the
        handling(/compiler/editor), when in fact the problem is in your code. (A quadruple closing quote is, in
        contrast, quite clearly highlit and triggers a compilation error.)
       <br>
       <br>
        On a practical note, as long as you have at least 2GB of physical memory, you 
        should experience no problems whatsoever constructing a string with 400 million
        characters, and you could more than treble that by allocating things up front.
        However: deliberately hogging the biggest block of memory the system will allow is
        generally considered bad programming practice, and may lead to disk thrashing.
        On 64-bit systems such limits can theoretically be multiplied by several billion. 
        As previously mentioned, pHeap.e contains the full and very scary low-down.
