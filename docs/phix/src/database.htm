       <b>Introduction</b>
       <br>
        The Phix distribution contains a copy of the Euphoria Database System (EDS), 
        slightly altered for automatic include handling, ie if you use
       <code>db_open()</code> etc
        but omit the preceding "include database.e" then Phix quietly loads it for you.
        The following notes were copied verbatim from the Euphoria documentation.
       <br>
       <br>
        See also <a href="pSQLite.htm">pSQLite</a>.
       <br>
       <br>
        None of these routines are supported by <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js"><b>pwa/p2js</b></span></a>
        - and I would be far more interested in getting pSQLite or similar operating through a PHP gateway,
        especially if that could be done completely seamlessly on desktop/Phix, localhost, and a web server.

         Many people have expressed an interest in accessing databases using 
         Euphoria programs. Those people have either wanted to access a
         name-brand database management system from Euphoria, or they&rsquo;ve 
         wanted a simple, easy-to-use, Euphoria-oriented database for storing data. 
         EDS is the latter. It provides a simple, very flexible, database system 
         for use by Euphoria programs.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Structure of an EDS database</b>
       <br>
       <br>
         In EDS, a database is a single file with ".edb" file type.
         An EDS database contains 0 or more
       <b>tables</b>. Each table has a name, and 
         contains 0 or more
       <b>records</b>. Each record consists of a
       <b>key</b> part, 
         and a
       <b>data</b> part. The key can be any Euphoria <a href="object.htm">object</a> - 
        an <a href="atom.htm">atom</a>, a <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a>, 
        a deeply-nested sequence, whatever. Similarly the 
        data can be any Euphoria object. There are no contraints on the 
        size or structure of the key or data. Within a given table, the keys 
        are all unique. That is, no two records in the same table can have 
        the same key part.
       <br>
       <br>
         The records of a table are stored in ascending order of key value.
         An efficient binary search is used when you refer to a record
         by key. You can also access records directly, with no search, if you 
         know the current record number within the table. Record numbers are from
         1 to the length (current number of records), of the table.
       <br>
       <br>
         The keys and data parts are stored in a compact form, but no accuracy is 
         lost when saving or restoring floating-point numbers or any other 
         Euphoria data.
       <br>
       <br>
         database.e will work as is, on Windows, DOS or Linux. The code runs 
         twice as fast on Linux as it does on DOS or Windows. EDS database files
         can be shared between Linux and DOS/Windows.
 <pre> 
 Example:
    database: "mydata.edb"
          first table: "passwords"
               record #1:  key: "jones"   data: "euphor123"
               record #2:  key: "smith"   data: "billgates"
        
          second table: "parts"
               record #1:  key: 134525    data: {"hammer", 15.95, 500}
               record #2:  key: 134526    data: {"saw", 25.95, 100}
               record #3:  key: 134530    data: {"screw driver", 5.50, 1500}
 </pre>
         It is up to you to interpret the meaning of the key and data.
         In keeping with the spirit of Euphoria, you have total flexibility. 
         Unlike most other database systems, an EDS record is
       <b>
        <i>not</i>
       </b> 
         required to 
         have either a fixed number of fields, or fields with a preset maximum length.
       <br>
       <br>
         In many cases there will not be any natural key value for your records.
         In those cases you should simply create a meaningless, but unique, 
         integer to be the key. Remember that you can always access the data 
         by record number. It is easy to loop through the records looking for 
         a particular field value.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How to use these routines</b>
       <br>
         To reduce the number of parameters that you have to pass,
         there is a notion of the
       <b>current database</b>, and
       <b>current table</b>.
         Most routines use these "current" values automatically.
         You normally start by opening (or creating) a database file, then
         selecting the table that you want to work with.
       <br>
       <br>
         You can map a key to a record number using db_find_key(). It uses
         an efficient binary search. Most of the other record-level routines 
         expect the record number as an argument. You can very quickly access 
         any record, given its number. You can access all the records by 
         starting at record number 1 and looping through to the record number 
         returned by db_table_size().
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How does storage get recycled?</b>
       <br>
         When you delete something, such as a record, the space for that item
         gets put on a free list, for future use. Adjacent free areas are 
         combined into larger free areas. When more space is needed, and no 
         suitable space is found on the free list, the file will grow in size.
         Currently there is no automatic way that a file will shrink in size, 
         but you can use db_compress() to completely rewrite a database,
         removing the unused spaces.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Security / Multi-user Access</b>
       <br>
         This release provides a simple way to lock an entire database to prevent
         unsafe access by other processes.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Scalability</b>
       <br>
         Internal pointers are 4 bytes. That limits the size of a database file to 4 Gb.
       <br>
       <br>
         The current algorithm allocates 4 bytes of memory per record in the 
         current table. So you&rsquo;ll need at least 4Mb RAM per million records
         on disk.
       <br>
       <br>
         The binary search for keys should work reasonably well for large tables.
       <br>
       <br>
         Inserts and deletes take slightly longer as a table gets larger.
       <br>
       <br>
         At the low end of the scale, it is possible to create extremely small
         databases without incurring much disk space overhead.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Disclaimer</b>
       <br>
         Do not store valuable data without a backup. 
         No responsiblility will be accepted for any damage or data loss.
