      <h1 class="title">Try/Catch Statement</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        A try statement allows a program to regain control following a normally fatal runtime error.
<!--eucode>
    try 
       <block> 
    catch e 
       <block> 
    end try 
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008080">    try 
</font><font color="#0000FF">       &lt;</font><font color="#000000">block</font><font color="#0000FF">&gt; 
</font><font color="#008080">    catch</font><font color="#000000"> e 
</font><font color="#0000FF">       &lt;</font><font color="#000000">block</font><font color="#0000FF">&gt; 
</font><font color="#008080">    end try </font>
</pre>
        In addition the builtin routine <a href="throw.htm">throw</a>() can be used to transfer control directly to the catch block, 
        potentially from within several nested routine calls.
        <br>
        <br>
        The catch statement traps an exception within the try block, or any routines it invokes, that is not first caught by another nested try/catch statement.<br>
        Any exceptions that must be re-thrown must be done so explicitly, and unlike other languages there is only one (non-optional) catch clause. <br>
        There are no confusing <i>classes</i> of exceptions, and no implicit filtering, and hence no unexpected leaks to the outside world.
        <br>
        <br>
        The exception variable is declared immediately after the catch keyword and is a <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a>.<br>
        It can be given any valid identifier as a name, though "e" is usually sufficient.<br>
        For details of the contents of the exception variable, see <a href="throw.htm">throw</a>().<br>
        Just like the loop control variables of for statements, it can be predeclared and then persists after the end try, 
        otherwise it is automatically declared and drops out of scope on the end try.

        Note that a try/catch statement may interfere with your ability to debug code within the try block (although trace and printf are still fine).<br>
        It can certainly negate the idea of a "fail fast" development methodology, should the program quietly soldier on rather than 
        immediately alert you to a problem and force you to fix it. <br>
        The authors of the Go programming language (and certainly neither Rob Pike nor Ken Thompson can be considered amateurs) at first
        completely omitted exceptions, but eventually (after some probably quite relentless pressure) added a panic/recover mechanism; 
        clearly they had their reservations, so perhaps you should too.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is no guarantee that all exceptions can be caught: rogue code that corrupts the stack will make it impossible to even look for a suitable handler.<br>
        The phix abort() and crash() routines now invoke throw() when an exception handler is detected, however the equivalent of the former in 
        non-phix code (ie kernel32.dll/ExitProcess or sys_exit from a dll/so or inline assembly) cannot be caught (by any means that I know or care of).
        Also, passing invalid arguments to throw() (e not atom when user_data not {}, or wrong-type-elements) is deemed to be non-catchable.
        Apart from that I am not currently aware of any errors, or any types or classes of error, that can never be caught.<br>
        <small>(In at least one release a try statement even had the power to prevent you from quitting a debug/trace session; it no longer re-throws e12pa, ie '!' keyed.)</small>
        <br>
        <br>
        There is no type checking on a catch clause, since <a href="throw.htm">throw</a>() always provides a <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a>, hence 
        user defined types <!--(&gt;T_object) --> are <i>not</i> permitted on predeclared exception variables.
        <br>
        <br>
        Obviously the compiler/runtime simply <i>cannot</i> distinguish &rsquo;blimey, who would think that could ever happen&rsquo; cases from 
        &rsquo;simple typo or other glaring error&rsquo;, and must therefore treat them identically.
        If you ever find yourself thinking that the runtime should quietly deal with those but tell you about these, then you are probably crediting it 
        with <i>way</i> too much intelligence (unless you can also think of a very simple rule to follow, which you and not me can then encode).
        <br>
        <br>
        The catch clause is actually opTryend (ie restore the previous exception handler, if any), then a jump to the end try, and then the actual catch
        handler itself (which also restores the previous exception handler, if any). Leaving a blank (or comment-only) line before the catch keyword may 
        make some listing files (-d command line option) slightly easier to follow.
        <br>
        <br>
        Compilation issues the error "invalid (circumvents try handler reset)" when appropriate.<br>
        The try block may not contain any exit/break/continue statements that would circumvent the reset of the handler. In contrast, return statements are 
        perfectly valid, as are any exit/break/continue statements within the catch block, or wholly nested within (/not leaking from) the try block.
        <dl>
        <dt>aside:</dt>
        <dd>However, the use of #ilASM{} to effect a jump with said circumvention is <i>not</i> protected against, but it will probably go horribly wrong, 
        should anything untoward happen, especially before a return discards the handler naturally, or a containing try effects a higher-level handler reset.
        The system stack is rebalanced along with the exception hander reset, mainly in case something happened deep inside a c_func/proc/call_back, and 
        hence jumping to the "wrong" handler may very well unbalance the system stack. (The triggering of a higher level catch may help.)</dd>
        </dl>
        Said compilation error can be avoided by setting a flag or two, then testing and performing the appropriate exit/break/continue after the end try.
        <br>
        <br>
        Compilation issues "Warning: empty catch block" messages when appropriate.<br>
        A blanket "ignore all" handler in the top-level main loop of an application may sound like an easy way to make your code "robust".<br>
        However it also risks making you completely blind towards any emerging problems - which can in some cases be perfectly fine - if a
        "jumping giraffe" game tries to draw the eyeballs off-screen, no-one cares, but a bug in the phix compiler is quite different.<br>
        At the very least you should consider something like <code>if DEBUG then ?9/0 end if</code> and in that way your live customers 
        can experience the trouble-free life you think they deserve, while your development staff are kept honest and immediately informed 
        of any developing issues, and forced to address them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Be warned that "trouble-free life" may turn into the classic headbutting a brick wall experience of no clue as to what is going wrong 
        - a log file of quietly ignored exceptions may help.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have four recommendations (which may overlap and overpreach a bit):
        <ol>

        <li>Write the code without a try container and see how far you get. Typically something like a subscript error can and should be
        fixed immediately, with the try statement being intended to guard against something completely different.
        If not careful, a try statement <i>will</i> mask errors that you might much rather it did not.<br></li>

        <li><sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>Always try and localise a try statement as much as possible, to cover the least amount of code and 
        solve a very specific problem.<br>
        <sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>Your catch clauses will obviously be much easier to write, and later read and understand.<br>
        <sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>While a catch clause can be used to "common up" error handling, don&rsquo;t go overboard.<br></li>

        <li><sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>Use try statements to deal with third-party code you cannot or would rather not modify, as 
        opposed to permission for your own sloppily-written abomination<sup><small>&#8482;</small></sup>.<br>
        <sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>A perfect example of the former: display "unable to play video" rather than let a corrupt file 
        euthanise your entire application.<br>

        <li><sup><small>&nbsp;</small></sup>Start a new catch clause as <code>?e</code>, then gradually add conditions and filters, with 
        comments, for specific cases where a "do nothing" response is genuinely the best thing to do.<br>
        Let everything you have not yet seen show up, including that bug you have just introduced, as well as the bug you probably will 
        introduce sometime next week.</li>

        </ol>

DEV I no longer care...
        Uncaught exceptions from throw() are reported inside the routine itself, in contrast to say printf() where the error is normally
        reported on the calling statement. Two thoughts: firstly, that reporting it on the call would throw away all the updates just done 
        to e[E_LINE] etc, though admittedly they are pretty well replicated in the normal scheme of error handling, and secondly, that the
        throw() call is unlikely to be any more helpful - what you probably want to do is walk back down the call stack in your search for
        a path with missing exception handling, so I may as well force you into walking the stack anyway.

-- Pretty much any run-time error is covered, however there are always going to be some exceptions 
-- that cannot be caught - for instance passing invalid parameters to throw() terminates abruptly, 
-- in preference to trying to blunder on with whatever nonsense it got. I might add that it takes 
-- some quite deliberate stupidity to trigger that one. Equally, handlers are nested so you cannot
-- guarantee some else won't get their size nine boots in first, or, for that matter, clobber the
-- internals of the handling mechanism.

        <br>
        <br>
DEV (TO GO):<br>
        Technicalia:<br>
        A new field is required in every frame on the call stack to contain the address of the exception handler. Obviously NULL means
        there is no handler, but also the special value 1 means there is one somewhere lower down the stack (so we need to issue fake
        opRetf until we reach it). opFrame will be responsible for setting that 0/1 on all new frames. I expect most of the support 
        code will live in builtins\VM\pStack.e, plus FEH.e will also contain a quick test on the new field to decide whether to invoke 
        ehandler or fehDiag.
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking at the current frame layout, {params/N/rtn/fromaddr/retaddr/prevebp/root}, it strikes me that retaddr is the one that
        is most critical, hence (perversely) I suggest replicating that past root, then clobbering the original one in the middle to 
        ensure we catch as many errors as we ever could. Obviously a) the first step is to add a null past root and get that working, 
        and b) this strategy has two benefits: the clobber of the original can be quickly undone, and we avoid the trap of thinking 
        we have got the slot done and dusted when the reality is that some edge cases (on vsb boundaries) still corrupt the stack.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every try statement will create a new local temporary to faciliate the save/restore of the exception handler field, as needed
        to cope with nested exception handlers.
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
        opTry ->        atom tmp := [ebp+NN];
                        [ebp+NN] := addr(:catch);

                        <i>&lt;block&gt;</i>

        opCatch ->      [ebp+NN] := tmp;
                        jmp :endtry
                    ::catch
                        [ebp+NN] := tmp;
                        sequence e := eax;

                        <i>&lt;block&gt;</i>

        opLabel ->  ::endtry
        
        opThrow ->      mov eax,[e]             -- (opUnassigned)
                        mov ecx,[user_data]     -- (or h4)
                        call :!pThrow           -- (see pDiagN.e)
</pre>
        throw() will be implemented mostly in hll, but it will need a hook into pDiag.e (or parts of pDiag.e factored out) to convert
        addresses into line numbers, etc. Perhaps if throw() is linked in, like routine_id(), interpretation should pre-populate the
        symtab with real names.
