            This color is used in all primitives (lines, areas, marks and text). Default value: CD_BLACK.

            In C, cdCanvasForeground performs a get/set with a conflict over CD_QUERY(/WHITE), and it is suggested to use cdCanvasSetForeground 
            to avoid that conflict (nb there is no C function named cdCanvasGetForground). In pGUI, the procedure cdCanvas<i><b>Set</b></i>Foreground 
            and the function cdCanvas<i><b>Get</b></i>Foreground are used in the obvious and non-conflicting way, though (not that I can imagine why) 
            you might (occasionally) need to replace one C call with a Get followed by a Set in pGUI.
            <br>
            <a name=cdForeground></a>
            <br>
            The C function cdForeground(c) is shorthand for cdCanvasForeground(cdActiveCanvas(),c), except for CD_QUERY, which it does not handle.<br>
            While technically the same issue might not be present, it seems prudent to keep things consistent, hence when translating from C (or for 
            that matter any other language binding) replace cdForeground() with cdSetForeground(), cdGetForegound(), or both.
            <br>
            <a name=cdBackground></a>
            <br>
            The routines cdCanvasSetBackground, cdCanvasGetBackground, cdSetBackground, and cdGetBackground are practically identical, and not separately documented,
            and likewise pGUI does <i>not</i> define cdBackround and cdCanvasBackground, instead there must always be either "Get" or "Set" in the routine name.<br>
            The cd[Canvas]SetBackground() routine only affects cd[Canvas]Clear().
