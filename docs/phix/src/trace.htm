            trace(3) is supported by the Euphoria To C Translator. Interactive tracing is not supported with the Translator.

            The trace() function is only available during interpretation; it is not and cannot be part of a compiled application, other than in p[w].exe. 
            Any thoughts of "trace a compiled application" suggest that there is a behavioural discrepancy (between compilation and interpretation) which 
            should be directly addressed as a bug in Phix. I know of no such cases, but it is only reasonable to expect one to crop up every now and again, 
            hopefully occuring quite rarely and promptly fixed.

            Tracing does not apply to inline assembly (#ilASM{}), only hll code.

          The trace() function itself does very little: just sets flags for subsequent opLnt (see builtins\VM\pTrace.e). <br>
          In fact the implemention actually invokes the trace routine even when 'with trace' is not active; apart from being 
          an utterly insignificant cost, it allows code the programmer would not normally wish to trace, such as the low-level 
          general-purpose code in builtins/VM, to trigger tracing in the calling application-specific code, or perhaps you have 
          a message handler which is called several million times and rather than trace that, you want it to start tracing when
          it gets back to whatever code triggered it to be invoked (perhaps quite indirectly) in a specific and unusual way.
          <br>
          <br>
          The internal routines that implement trace() must take great care over the handling of the stack and when referencing the 
          symbol table: in 'p test' there are two symbol tables, one for p.exe, which was probably built months ago, and one for 
          test.exw, which has just been built and only exists in memory. Furthermore, the very top entry on the stack, for 
          pTrace.e/show_trace(), is alien to the 'current' symbol table (see :%pSetSymPtr and :%pGetSymPtr), which 
          is not only ultimately restored from symtab[T_EBP][3] when interpretation/trace of test.exw finishes, but must also be and 
          is temporarily restored over things like pemit2.e/rebuild_callback(), ie anything that uses routine_ids or call_backs for
          routines that are actually within p.exe rather than being part of the end user application.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the parlour trick that is 'p p test', the underlying assumption is that trace and diagnostics ought to apply 
          to the first-level p.exw rather than the final test.exw, but that is not officially supported (tracewise) and neither are 
          'p p p test', 'p p p p test', etc. What <i>is</i> supported is 'p p test' with trace() 
          statements in p.exw and no such thing in test.exw, but only up to the point just before the interpreted copy of p tries to 
          run the binary that it just created for test.exw, with 'p p -norun test' being the safer way to do such things.
          <br>
          <br>
          While it remains a pretty good idea to first test any modifications to the compiler sources with 'p p test', 
          (see also builtins\VM\_readme.txt) that does <b><i>not</i></b> generally extend to any trace/profile functionality.
