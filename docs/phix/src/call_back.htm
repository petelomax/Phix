             The resulting address can be used by Windows, or an external 
             C routine in a Windows .dll or Linux shared library (.so), as
             a "call-back" address for calling your phix routine.

            When your routine is called, the argument values will all be machine-sized unsigned (positive) values. <br>
            You should declare each parameter of your routine as <a href="atom.htm">atom</a>, unless you want to impose tighter checking. <br>
            Your routine must return a machine-sized integer value.

            Theoretically call-backs are not thread safe, see Technicalia for details.

          There is a theoretical thread-safety issue with hll call_backs, although #ilASM may offer a workable alternative.
          <br>
          <br>
          The phix <a href="create_thread.htm">create_thread</a>() function (see builtins\VM\pThreadN.e) is responsible 
          for creating the virtual stack (see builtins\VM\pStack.e) in which the phix hll code of that thread will run. Should
          the c_func() code invoke CreateThread() or sys_fork() or whatever, there will be no virtual stack in which to run the 
          phix hll code. One example I read of is socket.connect(callback), which the article pointed out was asynchronous. In 
          such cases you may have to resort to using a low-level #ilASM{} label/code rather than a hll call_back(), and 
          obviously avoid attempting to make any hll calls, even indirectly, from that low-level callback code.
          <br>
          <br>
          I suppose it <i>might</i> be possible to create a special stack/context for the call-back if pSetSaveEBP/pGetTCB in
          pHeap.e fail, as per pGetPool, or perhaps just pGetPool/pFreePool at the start of cbhandler, but I cannot think of
          any way to release the orphans that would create. It might even be possible for the call back handler to create
          and destroy a virtual stack every time it is called, but that seems rather excessive. Also, either solution would 
          almost certainly make some error reports much shorter in a less than helpful way (ie no call stack).
          <br>
          <br>
          As far as I know, there are no genuinely asynchronous call_backs in OS-level calls, such as Windows API and Linux 
          syscalls, for instance the Windows API ReadFile in OVERLAPPED mode expects you to call GetOverlappedResult at your 
          convenience, rather than rudely interrupt you, and it is probably done that way for somewhat similar reasons.
