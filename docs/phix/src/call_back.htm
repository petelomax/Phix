            Get a machine address for the Phix routine with the <a href="routine_id.htm">routine_id</a> rid.
            <br>
            <br>
            The resulting address can be used by Windows, or an external C routine in a Windows .dll or 
            Linux shared library (.so), as a "call-back" address for calling your Phix routine.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second form, {'+',rid}, can/should be used on Windows if the routine will be called using 
            the CDECL calling convention, instead of STDCALL. <br>
            It has no effect when used on Linux, since that is always CDECL anyway.

         <td>You can set up as many call-back functions as you like.
          <br>
          <br>
            When your routine is called, the argument values will all be machine-sized unsigned (positive) values. <br>
            You should declare each parameter of your routine as <a href="atom.htm">atom</a>, unless you want to impose tighter checking. <br>
            Your routine must return a machine-sized integer value.
          <br>
          <br>
            Note that sign effects can come into play. The value -1 can, especially if it has been on a fairly colourful journey,
            arrive (on 32-bit) as #FFFFFFFF aka 4,294,967,295 and that will typecheck if you try and store it in an integer.
            Or it could occur the other way around completely, with some MAXUINT value in fact turning up as a -1.<br>
            Code within the callback should be robust and, if at all possible, automatically map such (parameter) values.
          <br>
          <br>
            Theoretically call-backs are not thread safe, see Technicalia for details.

          There is a theoretical thread-safety issue with hll call_backs, although #ilASM may offer a workable alternative.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Phix <a href="create_thread.htm">create_thread</a>() function (see builtins\VM\pThreadN.e) is responsible 
          for creating the virtual stack (see builtins\VM\pStack.e) in which the Phix hll code of that thread will run. Should
          the c_func() code invoke CreateThread() or sys_fork() or whatever, there will be no virtual stack in which to run the 
          Phix hll code. One example I read of is socket.connect(callback), which the article pointed out was asynchronous. In 
          such cases you may have to resort to using a low-level #ilASM{} label/code rather than a hll call_back(), and 
          obviously avoid attempting to make any hll calls, even indirectly, from that low-level callback code.
          <br>
          <br>
          I suppose it <i>might</i> be possible to create a special stack/context for the call-back if pSetSaveEBP/pGetTCB in
          pHeap.e fail, as per pGetPool, or perhaps just pGetPool/pFreePool at the start of cbhandler, but I cannot think of
          any way to release the orphans that would create. It might even be possible for the call back handler to create
          and destroy a virtual stack every time it is called, but that seems rather excessive. Also, either solution would 
          almost certainly make some error reports much shorter in a less than helpful way (ie no call stack).
          <br>
          <br>
          As far as I know, there are no genuinely asynchronous call_backs in OS-level calls, such as Windows API and Linux 
          syscalls, for instance the Windows API ReadFile in OVERLAPPED mode expects you to call GetOverlappedResult at your 
          convenience, rather than rudely interrupt you, and it is probably done that way for somewhat similar reasons.
