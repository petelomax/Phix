      <h1 class="title">format directive</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        The primary purpose of the format directive is cross-compilation, ie 32&lt;-&gt;64 and pe&lt;-&gt;elf (aka Windows&lt;-&gt;Linux).
       <br>
       <br> 
        If the format directive is completely omitted then suitable defaults for all values are provided,
        largely based on the compiler being run. For example, assuming -c, running the console version 
        (p.exe) creates a console executable whereas running pw.exe creates a gui executable. Likewise 
        running a 32-bit version of Phix by default creates a 32-bit executable whereas a 64-bit version 
        creates a 64-bit executable. And of course running a Windows version of Phix on a Windows machine
        by default creates a Windows PE format executable, whereas a Linux version on a Linux machine 
        creates a Linux ELF format executable (but running a PE format Phix under Wine will create a PE
        format output suitable for running under Wine). The format directive allows you to override that 
        default behaviour and has the following formal syntax:
 <pre>
    format "redirect.file"|
           (PE32|PE64) [GUI|console] [3.10|4.0|5.0] [DLL] [icons] [version] [manifest]|
           (ELF32|ELF64) [SO] | ARM</pre>
        As a simple example, you could just use ("-c" and) "format PE32".
        <br>
        <br>
        When DLL/SO is specified, the compiler collects export statements in the top-level file
        and uses that list (of symtab entry indexes) to construct the required export section.
        Note that constants (and enums) cannot be exported, and routines are subject to the same
        restrictions as <a href="call_back.htm">call_back</a> routines. You should also note that
        DLL/SO mandates the use of "-c -norun" on the command line, there is no interpret (or trace) 
        mode, and further that "-c -nodiag -norun" (or the shorter/easier but equivalent "-dll") is 
        recommended once things have been adequately tested.

        Note that instead of a format directive, <a href="requires.htm">requires</a>() and/or 
        <a href="with.htm">with/without javascript_semantics</a> should be used to <i>limit</i> the 
        platform(s) that Phix should attempt to run on/compile/transpile for, and prevent time being 
        wasted on those you know it will not work on (at least not without further effort).

        At the time of writing, SO are in progress/not yet supported. [DEV]
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that, as a relatively new addition, the format directive is subject to frequent change.
        One possible (but untried) use for the format directive might be for a library to assert that
        the target architecture is properly supported/tested, eg arwen.ew could begin with the line
        "format PE32|PE64" (literally including the "|") to assert that it does not run on ELF/ARM, or
        another component could have all four currently supported targets, as a safety measure against
        some other target being added in the future. (Note that arwen.ew is currently 32 bit only and 
        I have no plans to attempt a 64 bit version of it.)
        Consequently this section is likely to be updated as/when things get implemented/fixed.
       <br>
       <br>
        The format directive should be at the start of the main file, before any constant, variable, or
        routine definitions, or any executable code or include statements, but can be after namespace
        and with/without directives. To get technical for a moment, the real issue is that any #ilASM
        statements, as very commonly occuring in the builtins directory, are, before a format directive,
        rather likely to target the wrong architecture. Some special handling has been added to pmain.e 
        (see Z_format) to allow trace() and profile() to precede a format statement, however it may not 
        work in all cases. Likewise you may also get away with a few simple constants, etc. Otherwise 
        once any "prohibited code" has been processed the compiler simply issues an "invalid" error 
        against the word "format".
       <br>
       <br>
        At most two redirects are permitted. For example, p.exw has the directive 'format "p.fmt"'; 
        p.fmt is intended to contain one of 'format "pe32.fmt"', <wbr>'format "pe64.fmt"', <wbr>
        'format "elf32.fmt"', <wbr>or 'format "elf64.fmt"', <wbr>and finally pe32.fmt (etc) contains the actual 
        format directive. This allows me to work on the compiler and/or the test harness without keeping 
        several such directives in step, and also permits the build process to replace (and later restore)
        p.fmt for cross-compilation etc. A redirected file cannot contain anything other than a format 
        directive; pmain.e/DoFormat() issues a compilation error if it does not reach EOF. In case you
        have not guessed, if the token following the format keyword is a string, it is a filename. In 
        fact, a format "<i>filename</i>" directive is almost identical to an include <i>filename</i> 
        statement, except that the former expressly prohibits anything other than a format directive 
        in the target file. Also, redirects are ignored during interpretation, whereas an "inline" 
        format directive that specifies an incompatible architecture for interpretation causes a 
        compilation error.
       <br>
       <br>
        As an example, the file pe32.fmt distributed with Phix contains:
 <pre>
format PE32 4.0
icons {"ok.ico",{0,1}}
version { "FileDescription","Phix Programming Language",
          "LegalCopyright","Pete Lomax",
          "FileVersion","0.6.3",
          "ProductName","Phix Programming Language",
          "ProductVersion","0.6.3",
          "OriginalFilename","pw.exe" }
manifest `
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0"&gt;
 &lt;assemblyIdentity name="x.x.x" processorArchitecture="x86" version="5.1.0.0" type="win32"/&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;no&lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
   &lt;assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls" version="6.0.0.0" 
                     processorArchitecture="x86" publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df" language="*" /&gt;
  &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
 &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;`
 </pre>
        Unusually, perhaps, p.exw does not specify either GUI or console since it always creates p.exe and
        pw.exe anyway. Subsystem version 4.0 is the default for 32-bit executables and 5.0 the default for
        64-bit files (for PE format files, that is). Note that (the older) with/without console/gui affect
        exactly the same settings (variables OptConsole and subvers, which are defined in pglobals.e).
       <br>
       <br>
        The values shown above for icons and manifest coincide with the defaults (see pglobals.e). If the 
        version details (which must be an even number of strings) are omitted, then no version information 
        is output in the resulting executable file. There is no way to dynamically set any values during 
        compilation, though it should be trivial to (programmatically) create such a file beforehand.
       <br>
       <br>
        I believe (but I&rsquo;m not an expert) that a processorArchitecture of "*" would be best for
        PE32/PE64 compatibility. Since I encountered a problem trying to compile "x86" to PE64, I expect
        others will probably do so as well, and hence have implemented the following solution:
        <br>
        <br>
        Any "x86" in the manifest are automatically replaced with "amd64" (including the quotes)
        when PE64 is in force, as it seems that doing so is necessary to properly initialise the common
        controls (without manually invoking InitCommonControlsEx). This was originally only intended to 
        apply to the default rather than any explicit replacement, but since it is an easy fix to a 
        possibly fairly common mistake that would otherwise completely hose an application, it has been 
        deliberately left like that (applying across the board to everything).
        There is, however, no equivalent substitution of "amd64" with "x86" when PE32 is in force.
       <br>
       <br>
        Lastly, when using a 32-bit compiler to create a 64-bit executable, be aware that the integer range is redefined 
        as +/-#FFFF_FFFF rather than -#4000_0000_0000_0000 to #3FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF. See ptok.e/<wbr>setFLOAT() for all the 
        nitty-gritty details. It is also true that the value of PI, and possibly some other constants, will be slightly 
        out, by about one trillionth of one percent, when performing such cross-compilations.
       <br>
       <br>
        <a href="p2js.htm"><span class="pwap2js">pwa/p2js</span></a>: 
        Ignored/Not supported. On desktop/Phix, a format directive does not change interpretation one iota, except for
        DLL/SO which trigger an error if -c (or -dll) was not specified on the command line. There is no -c option in
        p2js (as yet), otherwise that handling is the same, and just like desktop/Phix without -c the format directive
        is largely ignored. Plus of course there is no sensible/practical way a browser could write an executable file 
        anyway, at least not without a bit of server-side code [as yet not even planned].
<!--
        forUnder p2jsare rejected ifchanges the default behavious of the -c option, 
        , and at the time of writing there is no code in 
        p2js to simply ignore any format directive, not that I am predicting that would be a spectacularly difficult thing 
        to add, but I&rsquo;ll hold off for now just in case any JavaScript-specific packaging requirements suddenly arise
         - I have not even made a start on p2js/Options yet.
