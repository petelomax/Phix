         <td>Euphoria will create a console
          <font color="CC3366">text</font> window
             for your program the first time that your program prints something to the
             screen, reads something from the keyboard, or in some way needs a
             console (similar to a DOS-prompt window). On WIN32 this window will
             automatically disappear when your program terminates, but you
             can call free_console() to make it disappear sooner. On Linux, the
             text mode console is always there, but an xterm window will disappear
             after Euphoria issues a "Press Enter" prompt at the end of execution.
          <br>
          <br>
             On Linux, free_console()
             will set the terminal parameters back to normal, undoing the effect
             that curses has on the screen.
          <br>
          <br>
            In a Linux xterm window, a call to free_console(), without any
            further printing to the screen or reading from the keyboard, will eliminate
            the "Press Enter" prompt that Euphoria normally issues at 
            the end of execution.
          <br>
          <br>
            After freeing the console window, you can create a new console
             window by printing something to the screen, or simply calling
             clear_screen(),
           <a href="position.htm">position()</a> or any
             other routine that needs a console.
          <br>
          <br>
            When you use the
           <font color="#030303">
            <b>trace</b>
           </font> facility,
             or when your program has an
             error, Euphoria will automatically create a console window
             to display trace information, error messages etc.
          <br>
          <br>
            There is a WIN32 API routine, FreeConsole() that does something
             similar to free_console(). You should use free_console(),
             because it lets the interpreter know that there is no longer
             a console.
