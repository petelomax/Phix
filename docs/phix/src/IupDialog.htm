            Creates a dialog element. It manages user interaction with the interface elements. For any interface element to be shown, it must be encapsulated in a dialog.

            child: the identifier of an interface element. The dialog has only one child. It can be NULL.<br>

         <td>
            Do not associate an IupDialog with the native "dialog" nomenclature in Windows, GTK or Motif. IupDialog use native standard windows in all drivers.
            <br>
            Except for the menu, all other elements must be inside a dialog to interact with the user. Therefore, an interface element will only be visible if its dialog is also visible.
            <br>
            The order of callback calling is system dependent. For instance, the <a href="callbacks.htm#RESIZE_CB">RESIZE_CB</a> and the SHOW_CB 
            are called in a different order in Win32 and in X-Windows when the dialog is shown for the first time.
            <br>
            Windows MDI support is composed of 3 components: the MDI frame window (IupDialog), the MDI client window (<a href="IupCanvas.htm">IupCanvas</a>) and the MDI children (IupDialog). 
            Although the MDI client is a <a href="IupCanvas.htm">IupCanvas</a> it is not used directly by the application, but it must be created and included in the dialog that will be the MDI frame, 
            other controls can also be available in the same dialog, like buttons and other canvases composing toolbars and status area. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The following picture illustrates the 3 components:

            Dialog’s size. Additionally the following values can also be defined for width and/or height: 
            <br>
            <br>
            "FULL": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to the screen width (or height) <br>
            "HALF": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to half the screen width (or height) <br>
            "THIRD": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/3 the screen width (or height) <br>
            "QUARTER": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/4 of the screen width (or height) <br>
            "EIGHTH": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/8 of the screen width (or height) <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> the above SIZE values are for IupDialog <i>only</i>, they will <b>not</b> work with other controls such as <a href="IupButton.htm">IupButton</a> 
            or <a href="IupFrame.htm">IupFrame</a>.<br>
            The dialog Natural size is only considered when the User size is not defined or when it is bigger than the Current size. <br>
            This behavior is different from a control that goes inside the dialog. <br>
            Because of that, when SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> are set (changing the User size), the Current size is internally reset to 0x0, 
            so the the Natural size can be considered when re-computing the Current size of the dialog.
            <br>
            <br>
            Values set at SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> attributes of a dialog are always accepted, regardless of the minimum size required by its children. <br>
            For a dialog to have the minimum necessary size to fit all elements contained in it, simply define SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> to NULL. <br>
            Also if you set SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> to be used as the initial size of the dialog, its contents will be limited to this size as the minimum size, <br>
            if you do not want that, then after showing the dialog reset this size to NULL so the dialog can be resized to smaller values. <br>
            But notice that its contents will still be limited by the Natural size, to also remove that limitation set SHRINK=YES. <br>
            To only change the User size in pixels, without resetting the Current size, set the USERSIZE attribute.
            <br>
            <br>
            Notice that the dialog size includes its decoration (it is the Window size), the area available for controls are returned by the dialog <a href="common.htm#CLIENTSIZE">CLIENTSIZE</a>. <br>
