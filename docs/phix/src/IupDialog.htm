            Creates a dialog element. It manages user interaction with the interface elements. For any interface element to be shown, it must be encapsulated in a dialog.
            <br>
            <br>
            child: the identifier of an interface element. The dialog has only one child. It can be NULL.<br>
            For more information on the attributes and args parameters see <a href="IupSetAttributes.htm">IupSetAttributes</a><br>
            bEsc: if true (the default) then <a href="IupClose.htm">IupCloseOnEscape</a>(ih) is applied automatically.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a similar fashion to <a href="paranormal.htm">paranormalised functions</a>, only slightly simpler, attributes and
            args are actually defined as <a href="object.htm">object</a>, so that IupDialog(<i>child</i>,false) behaves the same 
            as IupDialog(<i>child</i>,bEsc:=false), and likewise if the string attributes is present but args is omitted, 
            IupDialog(<i>child</i>,"<i>attributes</i>",false) behaves the same as 
            IupDialog(<i>child</i>,"<i>attributes</i>",bEsc:=false).
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that bEsc was added in version 0.8.3, prior to that it would behave as false, which meant that in nine out of
            ten cases a separate <a href="IupClose.htm">IupCloseOnEscape</a>(ih) was required. In some cases a 
            <a href="callbacks.htm#K_ANY">K_ANY</a> handler may shield you from any changes, in other (typically only top-level 
            window) cases you may need to add a false parameter, or perhaps separately/conditionally invoke 
            <a href="IupClose.htm">IupCloseOnEscape</a>(ih,false).
            <br>

            Do not associate an IupDialog with the native "dialog" nomenclature in Windows, GTK or Motif.<br>
            IupDialog use native standard windows in all drivers.
            <br>
            Except for the menu, all other elements must be inside a dialog to interact with the user.<br>
            An interface element will only be visible if the containing dialog is also visible.
            <br>
            The order of callback calling is system dependent. For instance, the <a href="callbacks.htm#RESIZE_CB">RESIZE_CB</a> 
            and the SHOW_CB are called in a different order in Win32 and in X-Windows when the dialog is shown for the first time.
            <br>
            Windows MDI support is composed of 3 components: <br>
            the MDI frame window (IupDialog), <br>
            the MDI client window (<a href="IupCanvas.htm">IupCanvas</a>) and <br>
            the MDI children (IupDialog). <br>
            Although the MDI client is a <a href="IupCanvas.htm">IupCanvas</a> it is not used directly by the application, 
            but it must be created and included in the dialog that will be the MDI frame, 
            other controls can also be available in the same dialog, like buttons and other canvases composing toolbars and status area. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The following picture illustrates the 3 components:
            <br>
            <img src="images/mdi.gif"/>
            <br>
            <h3>Custom Frame</h3>
            The use of custom frame is very popular nowadays. <br>
            But the system support is very poor, in Windows and in GTK. <br>
            So use it carefully and consciously of its glitches.
            <br>
            <br>
            In GTK is easier to understand because the frame is managed by the Window Manager. <br>
            So depending on the system it may be provided by the Windows Manager or it is simulated by IUP removing the window decoration.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Windows, there is no function or attribute to activate this feature in the Win32 API 
            (maybe in WPF there is, but we are stuck with the old API). <br>
            It is a combination of message handling with returned values in the WindowProc. <br>
            So sometimes the result is not what was expected. <br>
            For instance, if the application is not responding the old title bar interface is drawn over the top of the dialog just to 
            show the "Not Responding" at the window caption, even if the window does not have a caption. <br>
            We don&rsquo;t know how to avoid that. <br>
            Also the internal double buffer processing for the dialog is some how affected and a sequential of full redraw of the dialog has more flicker than usual.
            <br>
            <br>
            The CUSTOMFRAMESIMULATE attribute is a workaround that tries to solve the double buffer problem and has more control over 
            the custom frame behavior in general.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Important:</b><br>
            Almost all applications will benefit from <a href="IupSetAttributeHandle.htm">IupSetAttributeHandle</a>(<i>[NULL]</i>,"PARENTDIALOG",dlg).<br>
            It can really help to explicitly control focus behaviour, rather than rely on the often somewhat erratic default focus behaviour, especially 
            on Windows. Should closing a child window suddenly gift focus to a completely different application (often hiding the window that should have
            regained focus), or perhaps the Windows taskbar, then you need to think about setting PARENTDIALOG.<br>
            Obviously the top-level dialog should be set in the global attribute (I can&rsquo;t find any specific documentation about that) at program 
            startup, and each child dialog should (probably) use it&rsquo;s own private setting where possible, but some dialogs do not always have a 
            single specific parent, and things like <a href="IupMessage.htm">IupMessage</a>() simply don&rsquo;t have a private setting at all. For 
            those you may need to push/override and pop/restore the global PARENTDIALOG as various child windows are opened and closed, however as yet 
            there is no specific mechanism to assist with that, at least not in pGUI itself. <!-- pwa/p2js and PARENTDIALOG == ??? [DEV] -->

            "FULL": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to the screen width (or height) <br>
            "HALF": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to half the screen width (or height) <br>
            "THIRD": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/3 the screen width (or height) <br>
            "QUARTER": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/4 of the screen width (or height) <br>
            "EIGHTH": Makes the dialog width (or height) equal to 1/8 of the screen width (or height) <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> the above SIZE values are for IupDialog <i>only</i>, they will <b>not</b> work with other controls such as <a href="IupButton.htm">IupButton</a> 
            or <a href="IupFrame.htm">IupFrame</a>.<br>
            The dialog Natural size is only considered when the User size is not defined or when it is bigger than the Current size. <br>
            This behavior is different from a control that goes inside the dialog. <br>
            Because of that, when SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> are set (changing the User size), the Current size is internally reset to 0x0, 
            so the the Natural size can be considered when re-computing the Current size of the dialog.
            <br>
            <br>
            Values set at SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> attributes of a dialog are always accepted, regardless of the minimum size required by its children. <br>
            For a dialog to have the minimum necessary size to fit all elements contained in it, simply define SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> to NULL. <br>
            Also if you set SIZE or <a href="common.htm#RASTERSIZE">RASTERSIZE</a> to be used as the initial size of the dialog, its contents will be limited to this size as the minimum size, <br>
            if you do not want that, then after showing the dialog reset this size to NULL so the dialog can be resized to smaller values. <br>
            But notice that its contents will still be limited by the Natural size, to also remove that limitation set SHRINK=YES. <br>
            To only change the User size in pixels, without resetting the Current size, set the USERSIZE attribute.
            <br>
            <br>
            Notice that the dialog size includes its decoration (it is the Window size), the area available for controls are returned by the dialog <a href="common.htm#CLIENTSIZE">CLIENTSIZE</a>. <br>

            Allows the application to customize the dialog frame elements (the title and its buttons) by using IUP controls for its elements like 
            caption, minimize button, maximize button, and close buttons. <br>
            The custom frame support is entirely simulated by IUP, no native support for custom frame is used (this seems to have less drawbacks 
            on the application behavior). <br>
            The application is responsible for leaving space for the borders. <br>
            One drawback is that menu bars will not work. <br>
            For the dialog to be able to be moved an IupLabel, or a IupFlatLabel or an IupCanvas must be at the top of the dialog and must have 
            the NAME attribute set to CUSTOMFRAMECAPTION. <br>
            See the Custom Frame notes above. (since 3.28)
            <br>
            <br>
            By setting this attribute the following attributes will be set:
            <br>
            <br>
            <small><pre>
RESIZE=NO
MENUBOX=NO

BORDER=NO
TITLE=NULL
MENU=NULL
TASKBARBUTTON=SHOW
            </pre></small>
            <br>
            The BUTTON_CB and MOTION_CB callbacks of the dialog will be set too, so the dialog can be resized. <br>
            The BUTTON_CB and MOTION_CB callbacks of the element with NAME=CUSTOMFRAMECAPTION  will also be changed 
            so the dialog can be moved and maximized with double click. <br>
            It is the application&rsquo;s responsibility to implement the minimize, maximize and close buttons.

            FULL is similar to FULLSCREEN but only the dialog client area covers the screen area, menu and decorations will be there but out of the screen. <br>
            In UNIX there is a chance that the placement will not work correctly, that depends on the Window Manager. <br>
            In Windows, the SHOWNOACTIVE attribute can be set to Yes to prevent the window being made active. <br>
            In Windows, the SHOWMINIMIZENEXT attribute can be set to Yes to activate the next top-level window in the Z order when minimizing.<br>
            Under pwa/p2js MINIMIZED is not supported since that is more likely to be the job of the browser, rather than anything on a tab within the browser.<br>
<!-- DEV/SUG (untested/uncoded)
            Under pwa/p2js FULL makes the client fill the tab client only, whereas FULLSCREEN covers the entire screen including any browser window decorations.<br>
            In other words FULL makes it more like a normal web page, FULLSCREEN is what you would expect for playing games or watching movies.

            The custom frame support uses the native system support for custom frames. <br>

            One drawback is that menu bars will not work. <br>

            to CUSTOMFRAMECAPTION (since 3.22). <br>
            Native custom frames are supported only in Windows and in GTK version 3.10, so for older GTK versions we have to simulate the support 
            using CUSTOMFRAMESIMULATE. (since 3.18) (renamed in 3.22) (GTK support since 3.22) See the Custom Frame notes above.

            Note that dialog has an <a href="Ihandle.htm">Ihandln</a> type for the benefit of <a href="IupDestroy.htm">IupDestroy</a>().<br>
            On error, IupDialog() throws an exception rather than returning NULL, though most causes, such as attempting to put the same
            element on a dialog twice, are simple programming errors and the exception is not usually worth catching.
