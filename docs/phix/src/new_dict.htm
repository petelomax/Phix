            Creates a new dictionary, so that clashes with other uses of {key,data} pairings can be avoided, and optionally 
            initialises it with a set of {key,data} pairs, or a diagnostic name, or makes a complete copy of some other
            already existing dictionary.

            If kd_pairs is a string then it is treated as a name for the dictionary, which may be useful for diagnostic purposes,
            and can be retrieved using <a href="dict_name.htm">dict_name</a>().
            Otherwise every element of kd_pairs, if present, should be a <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a> of length 2, and said {key,data} gets passed to 
            <a href="setd.htm">setd</a>(), along with the id of the newly created dictionary.
            <br>
            <br>
            The returned tid is intended to be passed as the last parameter to <a href="setd.htm">setd</a>(), <a href="getd.htm">getd</a>(),
            <a href="deld.htm">deld</a>(), <a href="destroy_dict.htm">destroy_dict</a>(), <a href="traverse_dict.htm">traverse_dict</a>(),
            and similar, taking care not to miss any.
            <br>
            <br>
            For smaller applications, there is a default dictionary, 1, that can be used without ever calling new_dict(), however larger
            applications and in particular third party components will obviously benefit from keeping their data private (by the simple
            act of not sharing their <a name=tid></a>tid<small><sup><a href="#tid1">1</a></sup></small>).
            <br>
            <br>
            When you have no further use for it, an entire dictionary can be removed by invoking destroy_dict(tid), except for the
            default dictionary, 1, as mentioned above, which is special and is the only dictionary that cannot be deleted - attempts 
            to do so merely empty it and leave it still available for use.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dictionaries are <b>not</b> thread-safe, for details of that, or if you are curious about the mysterious pool_only
            parameter, see the <a href="#tech" onclick="opentech()">technicalia</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The copy_tid = new_dict(existing_tid) is fast, performing only a few top-level reference count increments.<br>
            Note however that it is only thread-safe if both copy_tid and existing_tid are only ever used by the same 
            thread, otherwise locking is required around each and every call to any routine from dict.e that is passed 
            either of those now-shared ids, and possibly around anything that uses the results from such calls (keys, 
            values, and ref counts of said). It is also not possible to make a copy of an existing dictionary and give 
            it a new diagnostic name, instead the copy just gets "".

            it would probably be fairly easy to change integer tid to {integer tid, string passkey} just to make it far harder to 
            accidentally replicate a tid.

            Multiple threads concurrently accessing dictionaries will cause corruption unless protected as shown in Example 2.<br>
            If your application is not multithreaded, or only one thread accesses dictionaries, then nothing that follows is of 
            <i>any</i> concern to you, and if I were you, I&rsquo;d get out while I still can.
            <br>
            <br>
            A single critical section protecting all dictionaries is normally sufficient, and in the vast majority of cases there
            would be no point making life any more difficult for yourself, however per-dictionary locks are also perfectly viable, 
            and if only one thread has access to a particular dictionary, then only new_dict() and destroy_dict() may need locking 
            - but for either of the last two options (ie per-dict and create/destroy-only-locking), then a big enough pool must be 
            created at the get-go:
            <br>
            <br>
            If pool_only is greater than 1, the routine adds the specified number of entries to the freelist and returns 0.
            Such a call is of course expected to be made before any <a href="create_thread.htm">create_thread</a>() or other
            new_dict() calls, and certainly before any <a href="destroy_dict.htm">destroy_dict</a>() calls - you should verify 
            the result actually is zero to guard against the latter.
            <br>
            <br>
            Subsequent invocations of new_dict(pool_only:=1) [presumably from within an appropriate critical section] will yield 0 
            if the pool is exhausted. In that case, the program should unlock, sleep and retry a bit later. You can actually specify
            a diagnostic name and pool_only of 1 (or 0), however passing a string plus pool_only>1 triggers a fatal error.
            <br>
            <br>
            If in fact you are trying to shut down, but other threads have died or forgotten to destroy_dict(), it is not entirely 
            unreasonable (after a time) to offer a "create anyway" option - it is not actually very likely, let alone guaranteed 
            to fail - unless some other thread is beavering away making as many calls to builtins\dict.e routines as it can.<br>
            I only mention this because systems which are multithreaded and require many dictionaries are somewhat more 
            likely to have complex and critical shutdown requirements, and stand to lose much more data if terminated abruptly.
            Tip: it costs very little to create a pool of say 500 dicts, and any such overhead would be completely and utterly 
            dwarfed by trying to create 500 threads. Conversely, limiting the pool size may keep memory useage spikes down and
            otherwise help spread out the workload.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let me reiterate to make all this as clear as possible: 
            <ul>
            <li>If the program is not multithreaded, or only one thread accesses dictionaries, no locking required, go away now.</li>
            <li>If multiple threads might access the same dictionary, locks are required around <i><b>every</b></i> call.</li>
            <li>In the latter case you can have one lock for all dictionaries or one lock per dictionary (see last two points).</li>
            <li>If a dictionary is only ever accessed by one thread, you can limit locking to new_dict/destroy_dict, but you
                <b><i>must</i></b> work within a limited-size pool of dictionaries (or lock <i>all</i> calls).</li>
            <li>Likewise any use of per-dictionary locks mandates the use of a limited-size pool of dictionaries.</li>
            <li>The locks around new_dict/destroy_dict calls must always of course be system-wide, not per-dictionary.</li>
            </ul>
