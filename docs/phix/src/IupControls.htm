      <h1 class="title">IupControls</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
        Several additional controls are included in a separate Controls Library.<br>
        These controls are drawn by IUP using CD on a IupCanvas control, and are not native controls.
        <br>
        <br>
        Applications making use of these controls may need to bundle iupcontrols.dll/so
        <br>
        <br>
        The IupControlsOpen function must be called after <a href="IupOpen.htm">IupOpen</a>, however pGUI does this automatically.
