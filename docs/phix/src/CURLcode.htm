            A libcurl error type, a small integer, currently in the range 0 to 92, plus some libcurl.e-specific values.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following table includes most, if not all, available error codes in libcurl. <br>
            Why they occur and possibly what you can do to fix the problem are also included.
            <br>
            <br>
            Almost all "easy" interface functions return a CURLcode error code. <br>
            No matter what, using the <a href="curl_easy_setopt.htm">curl_easy_setopt</a> option 
            <a href="CURLoption.htm#CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER">CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER</a> is a good idea as it 
            will give you a human readable error string that may offer more details about the cause of the error than just the error code. <br>
            <a href="CURLcode.htm#curl_easy_strerror">curl_easy_strerror</a> can be called to get an error string from a given CURLcode number.
            <br>
            <br>
            The types <a href="#CURLMcode">CURLMcode</a> and <a href="#CURLSHcode">CURLSHcode</a> are similar, see below.
