            Cleanup routines are associated with an object using the <a href="delete_routine.htm">delete_routine</a>() function.
            <br>
            <br>
            Applications do not typically invoke <a href="delete.htm">delete</a>() directly, but instead rely on it being invoked as part of the automatic 
            garbage collection process, except during shutdown when it may be important to force events to occur in a particular order.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the object is an integer, or if no cleanup routines are associated with the object, then nothing happens.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the cleanup routines are called, the value of the object is unchanged, though the cleanup routine(s) will no longer be associated with the object.
