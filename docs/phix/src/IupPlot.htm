            Creates a plot of one or more data sets. It inherits from IupCanvas.
            <br>
            <br>
            For more information on the attributes and data parameters see <a href="IupSetAttributes.htm">IupSetAttributes</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is an additional control that depends on the CD library. It is included in the IupControls library.
            <br>
            <br>
            It completely replaces the old IupPPlot control. This control eliminates all the limitations and issues we have with the PPlot library. <br>
            But we reused several PPlot source code parts, so we would like to thank the author Pier Philipsen for making it with a with a very flexible BSD License. <br>
            We also would like to thank Marian Trifon for the first IupPPlot implementation which part was also reused here. See "Differences from IupPPlot" bellow.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Initialization and Usage</h3>
            The IupPlotOpen function must be called after a IupOpen, so that the control can be used, however this is done automatically by IupPlot. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Guide</h3>
            The control can contain more than one plot in a rectangular grid. <br>
            Each plot will then has an exclusive plot area inside the control. <br>
            When it is just one plot this area will occupy the whole control area.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each plot can contain 2 axis (X and Y), a title, a legend box, a grid, a dataset area and as many datasets you want. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Each data set is added using the Auxiliary Functions. All other plot parameters are configured by attributes. <br>
            IupPlot support plots of linear sequential data, as a sequence of 2D samples ([x1,y1],[x2,y2],...) coordinates.
            <br>
            <br>
            If no attribute is set, the default values were selected to best display the plot.
            <br>
            <br>
            When setting attributes the plot is NOT redrawn until the <a href="#REDRAW">REDRAW</a> attribute is set or a redraw event occurs.
            <br>
            <br>
            The dataset area is delimited by a margin. <br>
            Data is only plotted inside the dataset area. <br>
            Axis and main title are positioned independent of this margin.
            <br>
            <br>
            The legend box is a list of the dataset names, each one drawn with the same color of the correspondent dataset. <br>
            The box can be located in one of the four corners of the dataset area.
            <br>
            <br>
            The grid is automatically spaced accordingly the current axis major ticks.
            <br>
            <br>
            The title is always centered in the top of the plot.
            <br>
            <br>
            The axis are always positioned at the left-bottom, except when cross-origin is enabled, then it is positioned 
            at the origin and zoom and pan will affect its position. Cross-origin will be automatically disable if a logarithm scale is used.
            <br>
            <a name=Interaction></a>
            <br>
            <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <h4>Zoom & Pan</h4>
            Zoom can be done while pressing the Ctrl key and interacting with the control. <br>
            A single click is with the left mouse button will zoom in by 10%, a single click with the right mouse button will zoom out by 10%. <br>
            The same result can be obtained by moving the mouse wheel. <br>
            To zoom in to a region, click with the left mouse button, drag to form a selection rectangle and release the button. <br>
            In all cases the Ctrl key must be pressed during the interaction.
            <br>
            <br>
            Zoom can be reset by double clicking with the left mouse button or pressing the "." key. <br>
            Zoom in and out can also be performed using the "+" and "-" keys respectively. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Pan is performed after zoom in and it does not uses the Ctrl key. <br>
            Simply click with the left mouse button and drag the plot to pan. <br>
            The mouse wheel will pan in the vertical direction by default, and when Shift is pressed will pan in the horizontal direction. <br>
            Pan can also be performed using the arrow keys, and with the PgDn/PgUp keys. <br>
            A single click with the middle mouse button will try to position the origin at that coordinate. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Zoom and Pan operate on <a href="#AXS_XMAX">AXS_XMAX</a>, <a href="#AXS_XMIN">AXS_XMIN</a>, <a href="#AXS_YMAX">AXS_YMAX</a>, 
            <a href="#AXS_YMIN">AXS_YMIN</a> even if <a href="#AUTOMIN">AXS_?AUTOMIN</a>/<a href="#AUTOMAX">AXS_?AUTOMAX</a> is enabled. <br>
            The axis may be hidden depending on the selected rectangle. <br>
            The <a href="#AUTOMIN">AXS_?AUTOMIN</a>/<a href="#AUTOMAX">AXS_?AUTOMAX</a> attributes will be disabled during zoom in, and restored when zoom out completely. <br>
            The zoom out and pan are limited to the original attribute values when zoom in started.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Cross Hair & TIP</h3>
            The cross hair cursor is activated and deactivated using the Ctrl+H or Ctrl+V key combinations. <br>
            When Ctrl+H is used the X coordinate will control the cursor, the Y coordinate will reflect each dataset correspondent value (a Horizontaly controlled cross-hair). <br>
            When Ctrl+V is used the Y coordinate will control the cursor, the X coordinate will reflect each dataset correspondent value (a Vertically controlled cross-hair).
            <br>
            <br>
            When the cursor is close to a sample, a <a href="common.htm#TIP">TIP</a> will be shown with the dataset name, sample index and coordinate values.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Selection</h3>
            Selection can be done while pressing the Shift key and interacting with the control. <br>
            To select all the samples inside a region, click with the left mouse button, drag to form a selection rectangle and release the button (while pressing the Shift key). <br>
            The new selection will always replace the previous one.
            <br>
            <br>
            To clear the selection just select an empty region or select an area with no samples. Pressing the Esc key will also clear the selection.
            <br>
            <br>
            After selecting samples use the Del key to remove the selected samples, but this will only work if <a href="#READONLY">READONLY</a>=NO.
            <br>
            <br>
            Selection and delete behavior can be controlled using the respective callbacks.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Context Menu</h3>
            The context menu is shown by a single click with the right mouse button. The default menu contains the following items:
 <pre>

            <dt><b>IupPlotSetFormula</b>(Ihandle ih, integer sample_count, string formula, nullable_string init)</dt>
            <dd>Creates a new dataset and generate samples using the formula. <br>
                The formula is executed for each sample within the dataset. <br>
                Internally uses Lua to parse the formula. <br>
                init is an optional Lua initialization code that is called only once (can be NULL). <br>
                The callback "int FORMULAINIT_CB(Ihandle* ih, lua_State *L);" can also be used to initialize the Lua state. <br>
                All Lua standard libraries are pre-loaded.
                <br>
                <br>
                This function is available in the "iupluaplot" library but it does not requires an active Lua context, because it uses a temporary Lua context.
                <br>
                <br>
                The formula will be encapsulated within an internal Lua function so it will not affect the call of subsequent samples. <br>
                This internal function receives two parameters "sample_index" and "x" correspondent to the current sample being processed during script execution. <br>
                "y" will be calculated by the formula. The formula can contain only one valid Lua statement that will be retuned by the internal Lua function. <br>
                The formula can evaluate to numbers only. The x parameter will vary from FORMULA_MIN and FORMULA_MAX attributes those default values are 0.0 and 1.0. <br>
                The interval will be divided in sample_count-1 steps.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the attribute FORMULA_PARAMETRIC is set to Yes, then the second attribute is replaced by "t". <br>
                The interval and the steps are the same BUT the formula must then return 2 numeric parameters: "x, y".
                <br>
                <br>
                The most commonly used tokens are:
 <pre>
+  (addition) 
-  (subtraction and negation) 
*  (multiplication) 
/  (division) 
%  (modulo)
^  (exponentiation)
== (equal)
~= (different)
&lt;  (less than)
&gt;  (greater than)
&lt;= (less than or equal)
&gt;= (greater than or equal)
and (logical and)
or  (logical or)
not (logical not)The Lua Math Functions are loaded also at the global level, so there is no need for the "math." prefix. 
 </pre>
                The most commonly used functions are:
 <pre>
abs(x)    acos(x)    asin(x)    atan(x)    atan2(y,x)    ceil(x)    cos(x)
deg(x)    exp(x)     floor(x)   log(x)     min(x,...)    max(x,...) pow(x,y)
sin(x)    sqrt(x)    tan(x)

            <h3>Differences from IupPPlot</h3>
            No STL dependency. All parameters and coordinates are in double floating point precision.
            <br>
            <br>
            Can draw using OpenGL. Internally will use the CD_GL driver so other CD metafile drivers can be used in IupPlotPaintTo.
            <br>
            <br>
            All IupPPlot attributes are supported, except DS_EDIT and EDIT* callbacks. Some attributes were renamed but the old names are also supported.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several new attributes and callbacks, check the documentation.
            <br>
            <br>
            IMPORTANT: interaction was heavily changed. Zoom, Pan and Selection is now done totally different from IupPPlot. See <a href="#Interaction">Interaction</a> above.

            The internal graphics mode. Can be set only before map. Can be OPENGL, IMAGERGB, NATIVEPLUS or NATIVE. <br>
            OPENGL will use OpenGL, it is faster for big data sets but text has a slightly slower quality, and has alpha and anti-aliasing support. <br>
            IMAGERGB is the slowest, has the same text issues as OpenGL, but also has alpha and anti-aliasing support. <br>
            NATIVE is the system default (GDI in Windows, GDK/Cairo in GTK 2/3, X11 in Motif) it has the best text render, it is fast for regular datasets, 
            but it does not have anti-aliasing nor alpha (except in GTK 3). <br>
            NATIVEPLUS uses GDI+ in Windows and Cairo in GTK 2, so it has anti-aliasing and alpha support. Default: NATIVEPLUS.
