         </td>
         <td>
            The glBindTexture function enables you to create a named texture. <br>
            Calling glBindTexture with target set to GL_TEXTURE_1D or GL_TEXTURE_2D, and texture set to the name of the new texture 
            you have created binds the texture name to the appropriate texture target. <br>
            When a texture is bound to a target, the previous binding for that target is no longer in effect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Texture names are unsigned integers with the value zero reserved to represent the default texture for each texture target. <br>
            Texture names and the corresponding texture contents are local to the shared display-list space of the current OpenGL rendering 
            context; two rendering contexts share texture names only if they also share display lists. <br>
            You can generate a set of new texture names using glGenTextures.
            <br>
            <br>
            When a texture is first bound, it assumes the dimensionality of its texture target; a texture bound to GL_TEXTURE_1D becomes 
            one-dimensional and a texture bound to GL_TEXTURE_2D becomes two-dimensional. <br>
            Operations you perform on a texture target also affect a texture bound to the target. <br>
            When you query a texture target, the return value is the state of the texture bound to it. <br>
            Texture targets become aliases for textures currently bound to them.
            <br>
            <br>
            When you bind a texture with glBindTexture, the binding remains active until a different texture is bound to the same target 
            or you delete the bound texture with the glDeleteTextures function. <br>
            Once you create a named texture you can bind it to a texture target that has the same dimensionality as often as needed.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is usually much faster to use glBindTexture to bind an existing named texture to one of the texture targets than it is 
            to reload the texture image using glTexImage1D or glTexImage2D. <br>
            For additional control of texturing performance, use glPrioritizeTextures.<br>
            You can include calls to glBindTexture in display lists.<br>
            Note: The glBindTexture function is only available in OpenGL version 1.1 or later.

            glGet with argument GL_TEXTURE_2D_BINDING
