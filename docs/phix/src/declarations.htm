         <b>Identifiers</b>
        </font>, which consist of
         variable names and other user-defined symbols, may be of any
         length. Upper and lower case are distinct. Identifiers must start with a
         letter and then be followed by letters, digits or underscores. The following

         <b>reserved words</b>

         have special meaning in Phix and may not be used as identifiers:

         Identifiers can be used in naming the following:
        <ul>
         <li><a href="procedures.htm">procedures</a>
         </li>
         <li><a href="functions.htm">functions</a>
         </li>
         <li><a href="types.htm">types</a>
         </li>
         <li><a href="variables.htm">variables</a>
         </li>
         <li><a href="constants.htm">constants</a>
         </li>
        </ul>
       <br>
       <br>
<!--
        The following can in fact be used in naming functions, but not the other four: <br>
        and, break, by, case, catch, constant, continue, default, do, else, elsif, end, enum, exit, 
        fallthru, fallthrough, for, function, if, include, not, or, procedure, return, switch, then, 
        to, try, type, while, with, without, xor.
       <br>
       <br>
        Obviously not recommended, but there is no parse conflict, as long as we do not allow 
        the implicit ignoring of function returns as in OpenEuphoria, ie the calling of a
        function (or type) as if it were a procedure - use <code>{}=func()</code> instead.
       <br>
       <br>
        The inverse list, that <i>cannot</i> be used in naming functions, is:<br>
        iff, iif, public, forward, global, export, private, ifdef, elsifdef, elsedef.
