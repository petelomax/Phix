            Unlock an open file fn, or a portion of file fn. You must have previously locked the file using lock_file(). <br>
            On Windows you can unlock a range of bytes within a file by specifying the range parameter as {first_byte, last_byte}.<br>
            The same range of bytes must have been locked by a previous call to lock_file(). <br>
            On Linux you can currently only lock or unlock an entire file. <br>
            The range parameter should be {} when you want to unlock an entire file. <br>
            On Linux, range must always be {}.

          You should unlock a file as soon as possible so other processes can use it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Any files that you have locked will be automatically unlocked when your program terminates.
