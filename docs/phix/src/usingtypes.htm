      <h1 class="title">Using Types</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
         So far you have already seen some examples of variable types but now we will
         define types more precisely.
       <br>
       <br>
         Variable declarations have a type name followed by a list of the variables
         being declared. For example,
<!--eucode>
    object a
    global integer x, y, z
    procedure fred(sequence q, sequence r)
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#004080">    object</font><font color="#000000"> a
</font><font color="#008080">    global</font><font color="#004080"> integer</font><font color="#000000"> x</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> y</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> z
</font><font color="#008080">    procedure</font><font color="#000000"> fred</font><font color="#0000FF">(</font><font color="#004080">sequence</font><font color="#000000"> q</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#004080"> sequence</font><font color="#000000"> r</font><font color="#0000FF">)</font>
</pre>
         The types:
        <a href="object.htm">object</a>,
        <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a>,
        <a href="string.htm">string</a>,
        <a href="atom.htm">atom</a>,
         and
        <a href="integer.htm">integer</a>
       are
       <a href="language.htm">
        <b>predefined</b>.
       </a>
         Variables of type <a href="object.htm">object</a> may take on <b><i>any</i></b> value.
         Those declared with type <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a> must always be sequences.
         Those declared with type <a href="string.htm">string</a> must always be strings (with every element fitting in a byte).
         Those declared with type <a href="atom.htm">atom</a> must always be atoms.
       <br>
       <a name=integer></a>
       <br>
         Those declared with type <a href="integer.htm">integer</a> must be atoms with integer values from -1073741824
         to +1073741823 inclusive. You can perform exact calculations on larger integer
         values, up to about 15 decimal digits, but declare them as <a href="atom.htm">atom</a>, rather than integer.
       <br>
       <a name=type></a>
       <br>
         To augment the
       <a href="usingtypes.htm">predefined types</a>, you can create
       <font color="#030303">
        <b>user-defined types</b>.
       </font> All you have to
         do is define a single-parameter function, but declare it with
       <font color="#030303">
        <b>type ... end type</b>
       </font> instead of
       <font color="#030303">
        <b>function ... end function</b>.
       </font>
         For example,
<!--eucode>
    type hour(integer x)
        return x>=0 and x<=23
    end type
    hour h1, h2
    h1 = 10      -- ok
    h2 = 25      -- error! program aborts with a message
</eucode-->
<pre>

</font><font color="#008080">    end type
</font><font color="#000000">    hour h1</font><font color="#0000FF">,</font><font color="#000000"> h2
    h1</font><font color="#0000FF"> =</font><font color="#000000"> 10     </font><font color="#000080"><i> -- ok

</pre>
         Variables h1 and h2 can only be assigned integer values in the range 0 to 23
         inclusive. After each assignment to h1 or h2 the interpreter will call hour(),
         passing the new value. The value will first be checked to see if it is an
         integer (because of "integer x"). If it is, the return statement will be
         executed to test the value of x (i.e. the new value of h1 or h2). If hour()
         returns true, execution continues normally. If hour() returns false then the
         program is aborted with a suitable diagnostic message.
        <br>
        <br>
         "hour" can be used to declare subroutine parameters as well:
<!--eucode>
     procedure set_time(hour h)
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008080">     procedure</font><font color="#000000"> set_time</font><font color="#0000FF">(</font><font color="#000000">hour h</font><font color="#0000FF">)</font>
</pre>
         set_time() can only be called with a reasonable value for parameter h,
         otherwise the program will abort with a message.
       <br>
       <br>
         A variable&rsquo;s type will be checked after each assignment to the variable
         (except where the compiler can predetermine that a check will not be
         necessary), and the program will terminate immediately if the type function
         returns false. Subroutine parameter types are checked each time that the
         subroutine is called. This checking guarantees that a variable can never have
         a value that does not belong to the type of that variable.

         Technically a user defined type can only be used to prove an object is definitely 
         <i>not</i> an instance of that type. While 4 is certainly an integer, it could be 
         an hour, or a minute, or second; there is no way to tell. 
         If a more precise implementation is required, instances must be explicitly tagged, 
         say {HOUR,4} or {MINUTE,4} where HOUR and MINUTE are application-unique constants 
         (you could in theory use the routine_id of the type definitions, or strings).
         Such a scheme might still yield "false positives" if the application contains any
         untagged sequences. In my experience such "more advanced" type systems catch very 
         few extra bugs, and indeed sometimes implement more bugs than they ever catch - 
         but don&rsquo;t let my opinion dissuade you - properly tagged user defined types 
         remain a perfectly valid tactic in the war against bugs, and indeed [temporary]
         human-readable tags (ie strings) can greatly simplify debugging.
<!--DEV more tests/thought required...
         <br>
         <br>
         For maximum flexibility, in terms of what you can test for being a given type,
         the type definition parameter should be declared as type object. However, that
         can limit compiler analysis leading to fewer potentially helpful error/warning 
         messages and possibly lower quality emitted code. 

         You can also "daisy-chain" type definitions to any depth, for instance worktime, 
         playtime, and sleeptime might be subsets of hour, and further lunchtime and 
         breaktime might be subsets of worktime. Note that when a type routine is invoked
         implicitly due to an assigment to a variable of that type, errors are propagated
         Whereas "function f(hour h)" may suffer
         a typecheck on the function definition line, "type playtime(hour h)" fails more
         gracefully, effectively propagating the error to the offending assignment, or 
         yielding false when it is invoked explicitly.

         Using
         object may reduce clarity and require additional explicit tests buried within
         the body of the type declaration, whereas more restrictive parameter types, 
         eg "type hour(integer x)" instead of "type hour(object x)", may require use of 
         additional clauses such as "if integer(x) and hour(x) then" to avoid crashes.

         Unlike other languages, the type of a variable does not affect any
         calculations on the variable. Only the value of the variable matters in an
         expression. The type just serves as an error check to prevent any "corruption"
         of the variable.
       <blockquote>
        Of course C and C-derived languages force the programmer to specify the exact
        low-level type of every value over and over and over again, and astonishingly
        as soon as they make the slightest mistake the compiler quietly "fixes" it for
        them using something called type coercion, which almost inevitably leads to a
        catastrophic failure that can be extremely difficult to track down. Obviously 
        a programmer with decades of experience handles such things with ease, but that
        is clearly not the case for newcomers. Phix turns the whole notion of types on 
        it&rsquo;s head: they are there to help the programmer, not punish them, and in
        no cases whatsoever, under any circumstances, do phix types alter the meaning
        of a value by discarding precision or treating a slightly negative number as
        a massive positive number, or any other such nonsense.
       </blockquote>
         Type checking can be turned on or off between subroutines using the
       <font color="#2C5C2C">
        <b>with type_check</b>
       </font> or
       <font color="#2C5C2C">
        <b>without type_check</b>
       </font>
       <a href="specialtop.htm">special statements</a>. The latter means that the
         above hour() routine does not get called and the <code>x&gt;=0 and x&lt;=23</code>
         test is not performed, however it does not allow for instance a string to be 
         stored in a variable declared as integer or cause the internal checking (or 
         fatal errors) of that sort of thing to be disabled.
        Type checking is initially on by default.

            When comparing the speed of phix programs against
            programs written in other languages, you should specify
          <font color="#2C5C2C">
           <b>without type_check</b>
          </font> at the top of the file.
             This gives phix permission to skip run-time
             type checks, thereby saving some execution time. All other checks are still
             performed, e.g. subscript checking, uninitialized variable checking etc.
             Even when you turn off type checking, phix reserves the right to make
             checks at strategic places, since this can actually allow it to run your
             program

            <i>faster</i>
           </b>
          </font> in many cases.
            So you may still get a type check failure even when you have turned off type checking. 
            Whether type checking is on or off, you will never get a
          <b>
           <i>machine-level</i>
          </b> exception.

         The phix method of defining types is much simpler than what you will 
         find in most other languages, yet it provides the programmer with
       <font color="#020202">
        <b>
         <i>greater</i>
        </b>
       </font> flexibility in
         defining the legal values for a type of data. Any algorithm
         can be used to include or exclude values. You can even declare a variable
         to be of type <a href="object.htm">object</a> which will allow it to take on
       <font color="#020202">
        <b>
         <i>any</i>
        </b>
       </font>
         value. Routines can
         be written to work with very specific types, or very general types.
       <br>
       <br>
         For small programs, there is little advantage to defining new types, and
         beginners may wish to stick with the five
       <a href="usingtypes.htm">predefined types</a>, or even
         declare all variables as <a href="object.htm">object</a>.
       <br>
       <br>
         For larger programs, strict type definitions can greatly aid the process
         of debugging. Logic errors are caught closer to their source and are not
         allowed to propagate in subtle ways throughout the rest of the program.
         Furthermore, it is much easier to reason about the misbehavior of a
         section of code when you know the variables involved always have a 
         legal/plausible value, albeit perhaps not precisely that desired.
       <br>
       <br>
         Types also provide meaningful, machine-checkable documentation about your
         program, making it easier for you or others to understand your code at a
         later date. Combined with the
       <a href="subscripts.htm">subscript checking</a>, uninitialized variable
         checking, and other checking that is always present, strict run-time type
         checking makes debugging much easier in phix than in most other
         languages. It also increases the reliability of the final program since
         many latent bugs that would have survived the testing phase in other
         languages will have been caught by phix.

         In porting a large C program to Euphoria (on which phix is based), a number
         of latent bugs were discovered. Although this C program was believed to be
         totally "correct", Rob found: a situation where an uninitialized variable
         was being read; a place where element number "-1" of an array was routinely
         written and read; and a situation where something was written just off the
         screen. These problems resulted in errors that were not easily visible to a
         casual observer, so they had survived testing of the C code.

         The Quick Sort algorithm presented on page 117 of
         <i>Writing Efficient Programs
         </i> by Jon Bentley has a subscript error! The algorithm will
         sometimes read the element just
         <i>before</i> the beginning of the array
         to be sorted, and will sometimes read the element just
         <i>after</i>
         the end of the array.
         Whatever garbage is read, the algorithm will still work - this is probably
         why the bug was never caught. But what if there isn&rsquo;t any (virtual) 
         memory just before or just after the array? Bentley later modifies the 
         algorithm such that this bug goes away -- but he presented this version as 
         being correct.

          When typical user-defined types are used extensively, type
         checking adds only 20 to 40 percent to execution time. Leave it on unless
         you really need the extra speed. You might also consider turning it off for
         just a few heavily-executed routines.
