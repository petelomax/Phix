            In phix this is just a simple wrapper for <a href="get_text.htm">get_text</a>, and as such 
            does not support reading from stdin(0).

            The filename parameter can be a string, in which case the file is opened and closed by this
            routine, or an integer from a previous call to <a href="open.htm">open</a>(), in which case
            it is not closed by this routine.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the file cannot be opened, -1 is returned.
