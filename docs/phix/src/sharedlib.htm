      <div id="mainSection">
        When a format directive such as "format PE32 DLL" is encountered, the Phix compiler attempts to produce a shared library.<br>
        Of course PE64 is also valid, as are ELF32/ELF64, but with SO instead of DLL. While "export" is normally treated as an 
        alias of "global", when creating a shared lib the compiler collects all top-level export routines in the main file and 
        uses that list to populate the export section.
        <br>
        <br>
        A requirement when producing shared libraries is that neither the main file nor any include file should generate any 
        top-level code whatsoever - since it would never be executed. One case in particular is "constant x = somefunc()".
        At the time of writing such things are not flagged as errors, but they should be.
        <br>
        <br>
        Phix takes the stern line that any dll/so it creates should be universally valid: it is no good returning a 
        <a href="sequence.htm">sequence</a> to a C program that cannot comprehend it (and the same with phix-style 
        <a href="string.htm">strings</a>, though <a href="IupRawStringPtr.htm">IupRawStringPtr</a> or something similar 
        might be a possibility).<br>
        In a similar vein it might sound dandy having a dll routine that accepts (nested) sequences, but really there is little
        point if only phix knows how to invoke it - ultimately, the more you think about it, phix should not care if the dll it 
        happens to be calling was written in Phix, C, or any other language, or for that matter harbour any hidden lists of 
        language-specific caveats, or indeed force anyone else using the result of your efforts into using phix.<br>
        Instead, therefore, <b>all parameters and return values of all export routines must be atom.</b><br>
        (Note that you can pass strings directly to <i>any</i> dll, but they will always arrive in raw atom pointer form, aka
        char*.)
        <br>
        <br>
        Likewise you cannot allocate memory in a shared lib and free it in a completely separate module, or for that matter, free
        memory in a dll/so that was originally allocated elsewhere. When necessary the programmer must engineer some appropriate 
        callback(s) to achieve the required result. I am of course talking about hll <a href="allocate.htm">allocate</a>() and 
        <a href="free.htm">free</a>() - on Windows, should it prove absolutely necessary for some fixed API, you may be able to 
        utilise kernel32/<wbr>GlobalAlloc/<wbr>LocalAlloc/<wbr>HeapAlloc/<wbr>VirtualAlloc/<wbr>CoTaskMemAlloc etc directly, 
        and likewise malloc/<wbr>free on Linux, as long as clib/<wbr>glibc is dynamically and not statically linked.
        <br>
        <br>
        In practice, when the compiler populates the export section, it does so via "static callbacks" which act as a kind of
        "trampoline", converting full 32/64-bit values to 31/63-bit integers or floats, etc, as required by the phix runtime.
        This further cements the requirement that all exports be fully callback-compatible.
        <br>
        <br>
        For Windows, special treatment is given to an 
        export function DllMain(<a href="atom.htm">atom</a> hinstDLL, <a href="integer.htm">integer</a> fdwReason, <a href="atom.htm">atom</a> lpvReserved), 
        which should be kept as simple as possible, and according to the official Microsoft documentation must not invoke any of:
        dll_open/LoadLibrary, FreeLibrary, GetStringType, CoInitialize, CreateProcess, create_thread/CreateThread, 
        exit_thread/ExitThread, CreateNamedPipe, or any registry functions - in short, defer everything you can. <br>
        If such a function is detected, it is moved to the top of the list and becomes the main entry point for LoadLibrary; <br>
        if no such function is detected, the equivalent of a simple return 1 is automatically inserted, <br>
        in either case the standard :>init routine processing is always performed first. <br>
        You should also note that a DllMain that does anything other than return 1 is unlikely to work properly on Linux, since 
        that code will/may never be executed.
        <br>

[DEV (Linux)]
        Linux shared libraries are not supported at the time of writing. It creates a .so, but with incorrect relocations and an 
        empty DT_REL. Most things found online strongly suggest pic (position independant code) is the only way to go, but that 
        would be very difficult, especially for the data section, however libiup.so analysis suggests that relocations are fine.
        Since Linux has no equivalent mechanism to kernel32/LoadLibrary (ie DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) it should not matter whether a
        DllMain exists or not (unless you call it manually). The initial code is likely to become something like: 
<!--eucode>
    ::top
        <call >:init
--      ret (not necessary, :>initStack clears the following field)
    ::check
        cmp dword[ds+12]|qword[ds+16],0
        jne :top
        ret
</eucode-->
<pre>
<font color="#000000"></font><font color="#0000FF">    ::</font><font color="#000000">top
</font><font color="#0000FF">        &lt;</font><font color="#7060A8">call</font><font color="#0000FF"> &gt;:</font><font color="#000000">init
</font><font color="#000080"><i>--      ret (not necessary, :&gt;initStack clears the following field)
</i></font><font color="#0000FF">    ::</font><font color="#000000">check
        cmp dword</font><font color="#0000FF">[</font><font color="#000000">ds</font><font color="#0000FF">+</font><font color="#000000">12</font><font color="#0000FF">]|</font><font color="#000000">qword</font><font color="#0000FF">[</font><font color="#000000">ds</font><font color="#0000FF">+</font><font color="#000000">16</font><font color="#0000FF">],</font><font color="#000000">0
        jne</font><font color="#0000FF"> :</font><font color="#000000">top
        ret</font>
</pre>
        with :check being invoked from every "static callback" for every top-level export routine. (see pilx86.e/opInit)
        I should also note that pbinary.e/CreateELF() currently does nothing (useful) with the exports parameter.
        No timescale is offered, but hopefully it will be a matter of several relatively small tweaks, as opposed to a drastic 
        system-wide rewrite.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the time of writing no attempt has been made to allow export variables - in any case non-integers would have to be
        phix-style refs that only Phix understands, and hence they would be of very limited use anyway, and besides it is not
        particularly difficult to compose suitable getter/setter routines instead.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, I trust it goes without saying that there is no way to "interpret" a shared lib, and hence there can be no way
        to trace/debug it at the source code level.
        [DEV] Also, no testing has been done yet that errors in dll files generate sensible ex.err files.
