            Just as <a href="abort.htm">abort</a>() terminates the entire application (and will still do so even if
            invoked from a worker thread), exit_thread() terminates the current thread, and can safely be invoked
            even several levels deep in nested calls. <br>
            Note that exit_thread() must be avoided at all costs when <a href="mtask.htm">multitasking</a> is in use, 
            as per <a href="suspend_thread.htm">suspend_thread</a>().
            <br>
            <br>
            Properly written code should use an exitcode of 0 and send appropriate messages on failure before terminating.
            <br>
            <br>
            An idle <a href="wait_thread.htm">wait_thread</a>() is properly signalled following an exit_thread().
            <br>
            <br>
            However, should you really want to monitor/poll active threads, the exit code can be retrieved via 
            <a href="get_thread_exitcode.htm">get_thread_exitcode</a>(). There will of course be times when such a
            more obvious quick and dirty way is entirely appropriate.
            <br>
            <br>
            While the thread is still active, <a href="get_thread_exitcode.htm">get_thread_exitcode</a> returns 
            STILL_ACTIVE (=259), so obviously that particular value should be avoided.
